NAME
       bash - GNU Bourne-Again SHell

SYNOPSIS
       bash [options] [command_string | file]

COPYRIGHT
       Bash is Copyright (C) 1989-2022 by the Free Software Foundation, Inc.

DESCRIPTION
       Bash  is  an  sh-compatible command language interpreter that executes commands read from
       the standard input or from a file.  Bash also incorporates useful features from the  Korn
       and C shells (ksh and csh).

       Bash  is intended to be a conformant implementation of the Shell and Utilities portion of
       the IEEE POSIX specification (IEEE Standard 1003.1).  Bash can be configured to be POSIX-
       conformant by default.

OPTIONS
       All  of  the  single-character  shell  options  documented  in the description of the set
       builtin command, including -o, can be used as options when the shell is invoked.  In  adâ€
       dition, bash interprets the following options when it is invoked:

   Brace Expansion
       Brace expansion is a mechanism by which arbitrary strings may be generated.  This  mechaâ€
       nism  is similar to pathname expansion, but the filenames generated need not exist.  Patâ€
       terns to be brace expanded take the form of an optional preamble, followed  by  either  a
       series of comma-separated strings or a sequence expression between a pair of braces, folâ€
       lowed by an optional postscript.  The preamble  is  prefixed  to  each  string  contained
       within  the braces, and the postscript is then appended to each resulting string, expandâ€
       ing left to right.

       Brace expansions may be nested.  The results of each expanded string are not sorted; left
       to right order is preserved.  For example, a{d,c,b}e expands into `ade ace abe'.

       A sequence expression takes the form {x..y[..incr]}, where x and y are either integers or
       single letters, and incr, an optional increment, is an integer.  When integers  are  supâ€
       plied,  the expression expands to each number between x and y, inclusive.  Supplied inteâ€
       gers may be prefixed with 0 to force each term to have the same width.  When either x  or
       y begins with a zero, the shell attempts to force all generated terms to contain the same
       number of digits, zero-padding where necessary.  When letters are supplied,  the  expresâ€
       sion  expands  to  each character lexicographically between x and y, inclusive, using the
       default C locale.  Note that both x and y must be of the same type (integer  or  letter).
       When  the increment is supplied, it is used as the difference between each term.  The deâ€
       fault increment is 1 or -1 as appropriate.

       Brace expansion is performed before any other expansions, and any characters  special  to
       other expansions are preserved in the result.  It is strictly textual.  Bash does not apâ€
       ply any syntactic interpretation to the context of the expansion or the text between  the
       braces.ash(1) line 1348/5660 25% (press h for help or q to quit)
 ESESCOBpage bash(1) line 1349/5660 25% (press h for help or q to quit)
       A  correctly-formed brace expansion must contain unquoted opening and closing braces, and
       at least one unquoted comma or a valid sequence expression.  Any incorrectly formed brace
       expansion  is left unchanged.  A { or , may be quoted with a backslash to prevent its beâ€
M       within  the braces, and the postscript is then appended to each resulting string, expandâ€

       within  the braces, and the postscript is then appended to each resulting string, expandâ€
       ing left to right.

       Brace expansions may be nested.  The results of each expanded string are not sorted; left
       to right order is preserved.  For example, a{d,c,b}e expands into `ade ace abe'.

       A sequence expression takes the form {x..y[..incr]}, where x and y are either integers or
       single letters, and incr, an optional increment, is an integer.  When integers  are  supâ€
       plied,  the expression expands to each number between x and y, inclusive.  Supplied inteâ€
       gers may be prefixed with 0 to force each term to have the same width.  When either x  or
       y begins with a zero, the shell attempts to force all generated terms to contain the same
       number of digits, zero-padding where necessary.  When letters are supplied,  the  expresâ€
       sion  expands  to  each character lexicographically between x and y, inclusive, using the
       default C locale.  Note that both x and y must be of the same type (integer  or  letter).
       When  the increment is supplied, it is used as the difference between each term.  The deâ€
       fault increment is 1 or -1 as appropriate.

       Brace expansion is performed before any other expansions, and any characters  special  to
       other expansions are preserved in the result.  It is strictly textual.  Bash does not apâ€
       ply any syntactic interpretation to the context of the expansion or the text between  the
       braces.

       A  correctly-formed brace expansion must contain unquoted opening and closing braces, and
       at least one unquoted comma or a valid sequence expression.  Any incorrectly formed brace

           referenced directly or through a dependency, units that are pinned by applications
           programmatically, or units that were active in the past and have failed. By default
           only units which are active, have pending jobs, or have failed are shown; this can be
           changed with option --all. If one or more PATTERNs are specified, only units matching
           one of them are shown. The units that are shown are additionally filtered by --type=

           Note that this command does not show unit templates, but only instances of unit
           templates. Units templates that aren't instantiated are not runnable, and will thus
           never show up in the output of this command. Specifically this means that

NAME
       systemctl - Control the systemd system and service manager

SYNOPSIS

       systemctl [OPTIONS...] COMMAND [UNIT...]

DESCRIPTION
       systemctl may be used to introspect and control the state of the "systemd" system and
       service manager. Please refer to systemd(1) for an introduction into the basic concepts
       and functionality this tool manages.

COMMANDS
       The following commands are understood:

   Unit Commands (Introspection and Modification)
       list-units [PATTERN...]
           List units that systemd currently has in memory. This includes units that are either
           referenced directly or through a dependency, units that are pinned by applications
           programmatically, or units that were active in the past and have failed. By default
           only units which are active, have pending jobs, or have failed are shown; this can be
           changed with option --all. If one or more PATTERNs are specified, only units matching
           one of them are shown. The units that are shown are additionally filtered by --type=
           and --state= if those options are specified.

           Note that this command does not show unit templates, but only instances of unit
           templates. Units templates that aren't instantiated are not runnable, and will thus
           never show up in the output of this command. Specifically this means that
           foo@.service will never be shown in this list â€” unless instantiated, e.g. as
           foo@bar.service. Use list-unit-files (see below) for listing installed unit template
           files.

NAME
       systemctl - Control the systemd system and service manager

SYNOPSIS

       systemctl [OPTIONS...] COMMAND [UNIT...]

DESCRIPTION
       systemctl may be used to introspect and control the state of the "systemd" system and
       service manager. Please refer to systemd(1) for an introduction into the basic concepts
       and functionality this tool manages.

COMMANDS
       The following commands are understood:

   Unit Commands (Introspection and Modification)
       list-units [PATTERN...]
           List units that systemd currently has in memory. This includes units that are either
           referenced directly or through a dependency, units that are pinned by applications
           programmatically, or units that were active in the past and have failed. By default
           only units which are active, have pending jobs, or have failed are shown; this can be
           changed with option --all. If one or more PATTERNs are specified, only units matching
           one of them are shown. The units that are shown are additionally filtered by --type=
           and --state= if those options are specified.

           Note that this command does not show unit templates, but only instances of unit
           templates. Units templates that aren't instantiated are not runnable, and will thus
           never show up in the output of this command. Specifically this means that
           foo@.service will never be shown in this list â€” unless instantiated, e.g. as
           foo@bar.service. Use list-unit-files (see below) for listing installed unit template
           files.

           Produces output similar to

                 UNIT                         LOAD   ACTIVE SUB     DESCRIPTION
                 sys-module-fuse.device       loaded active plugged /sys/module/fuse
                 -.mount                      loaded active mounted Root Mount
                 boot-efi.mount               loaded active mounted /boot/efi
Invalid mark letter    (press RETURN)...skipping... or q to quit)
           referenced directly or through a dependency, units that are pinned by applications
           programmatically, or units that were active in the past and have failed. By default
           only units which are active, have pending jobs, or have failed are shown; this can be
           changed with option --all. If one or more PATTERNs are specified, only units matching
           one of them are shown. The units that are shown are additionally filtered by --type=
           and --state= if those options are specified.

           Note that this command does not show unit templates, but only instances of unit
           templates. Units templates that aren't instantiated are not runnable, and will thus
           never show up in the output of this command. Specifically this means that
           foo@.service will never be shown in this list â€” unless instantiated, e.g. as
           foo@bar.service. Use list-unit-files (see below) for listing installed unit template
           files.

           Produces output similar to

                 UNIT                         LOAD   ACTIVE SUB     DESCRIPTION
                 sys-module-fuse.device       loaded active plugged /sys/module/fuse
                 -.mount                      loaded active mounted Root Mount
                 boot-efi.mount               loaded active mounted /boot/efi
                 systemd-journald.service     loaded active running Journal Service
                 systemd-logind.service       loaded active running Login Service
               â— user@1000.service            loaded failed failed  User Manager for UID 1000
                 ...
                 systemd-tmpfiles-clean.timer loaded active waiting Daily Cleanup of Temporary Directories

               LOAD   = Reflects whether the unit definition was properly loaded.
               ACTIVE = The high-level unit activation state, i.e. generalization of SUB.
               SUB    = The low-level unit activation state, values depend on unit type.

               123 loaded units listed. Pass --all to see loaded but inactive units, too.
               To show all installed unit files use 'systemctl list-unit-files'.

           The header and the last unit of a given type are underlined if the terminal supports
           that. A colored dot is shown next to services which were masked, not found, or
           otherwise failed.

           The LOAD column shows the load state, one of loaded, not-found, bad-setting, error,
           masked. The ACTIVE columns shows the general unit state, one of active, reloading,
           inactive, failed, activating, deactivating. The SUB column shows the
           unit-type-specific detailed state of the unit, possible values vary by unit type. The
           list of possible LOAD, ACTIVE, and SUB states is not constant and new systemd
           releases may both add and remove values.

               systemctl --state=help

           command may be used to display the current set of possible values.

           This is the default command.

       list-automounts [PATTERN...]
           List automount units currently in memory, ordered by mount path. If one or more
           PATTERNs are specified, only automount units matching one of them are shown. Produces
           output similar to

               WHAT        WHERE                    MOUNTED IDLE TIMEOUT UNIT

 ESESCOD           inactive, failed, activating, deactivating. The SUB column shows the
           unit-type-specific detailed state of the unit, possible values vary by unit type. The
           list of possible LOAD, ACTIVE, and SUB states is not constant and new systemd
           releases may both add and remove values.

               systemctl --state=help

           command may be used to display the current set of possible values.

           This is the default command.

           List automount units currently in memory, ordered by mount path. If one or more
           PATTERNs are specified, only automount units matching one of them are shown. Produces
           output similar to

               binfmt_misc /proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc yes     0            proc-sys-fs-binfmt_misc.automount
 ESESCOD           inactive, failed, activating, deactivating. The SUB column shows the
           unit-type-specific detailed state of the unit, possible values vary by unit type. The
           list of possible LOAD, ACTIVE, and SUB states is not constant and new systemd
           releases may both add and remove values.

               systemctl --state=help

       list-paths [PATTERN...]
           List path units currently in memory, ordered by path. If one or more PATTERNs are
           specified, only path units matching one of them are shown. Produces output similar to

               PATH                           CONDITION         UNIT                               ACTIVATES

       list-sockets [PATTERN...]
           List socket units currently in memory, ordered by listening address. If one or more
           PATTERNs are specified, only socket units matching one of them are shown. Produces
           output similar to

       is-active PATTERN...
           Check whether any of the specified units are active (i.e. running). Returns an exit
           code 0 if at least one is active, or non-zero otherwise. Unless --quiet is specified,
           this will also print the current unit state to standard output.

       is-failed [PATTERN...]
           Check whether any of the specified units is in the "failed" state. If no unit is
           specified, check whether there are any failed units, which corresponds to the
           "degraded" state returned by is-system-running. Returns an exit code 0 if at least
           one has failed, non-zero otherwise. Unless --quiet is specified, this will also print
           the current unit or system state to standard output.

           Added in version 197.

       status [PATTERN...|PID...]]
           Show runtime status information about the whole system or about one or more units
           followed by most recent log data from the journal. If no positional arguments are
           specified, and no unit filter is given with --type=, --state=, or --failed, shows the
           status of the whole system. If combined with --all, follows that with the status of
           all units. If positional arguments are specified, each positional argument is treated
           as either a unit name to show, or a glob pattern to show units whose names match that
           pattern, or a PID to show the unit containing that PID. When --type=, --state=, or
           --failed are used, units are additionally filtered by the TYPE and ACTIVE state.

           This function is intended to generate human-readable output. If you are looking for
           computer-parsable output, use show instead. By default, this function only shows 10
           lines of output and ellipsizes lines to fit in the terminal window. This can be
           changed with --lines and --full, see above. In addition, journalctl --unit=NAME or
           journalctl --user-unit=NAME use a similar filter for messages and might be more
           convenient.

           Note that this operation only displays runtime status, i.e. information about the
           current invocation of the unit (if it is running) or the most recent invocation (if
           it is not running anymore, and has not been released from memory). Information about
           earlier invocations, invocations from previous system boots, or prior invocations
           that have already been released from memory may be retrieved via journalctl --unit=.

           systemd implicitly loads units as necessary, so just running the status will attempt
           to load a file. The command is thus not useful for determining if something was
           already loaded or not. The units may possibly also be quickly unloaded after the
           operation is completed if there's no reason to keep it in memory thereafter.

M           pattern, or a PID to show the unit containing that PID. When --type=, --state=, or
M           as either a unit name to show, or a glob pattern to show units whose names match that
M           all units. If positional arguments are specified, each positional argument is treated
M           status of the whole system. If combined with --all, follows that with the status of
M           specified, and no unit filter is given with --type=, --state=, or --failed, shows the
M           followed by most recent log data from the journal. If no positional arguments are
M           Show runtime status information about the whole system or about one or more units

           The "Active:" line shows active state. The value is usually "active" or "inactive".
           Active could mean started, bound, plugged in, etc depending on the unit type. The
           unit could also be in process of changing states, reporting a state of "activating"
           or "deactivating". A special "failed" state is entered when the service failed in
           some way, such as a crash, exiting with an error code or timing out. If the failed
           state is entered the cause will be logged for later reference.

           Many properties shown by systemctl show map directly to configuration settings of the
           system and service manager and its unit files. Note that the properties shown by the
           command are generally more low-level, normalized versions of the original
           configuration settings and expose runtime state in addition to configuration. For
           example, properties shown for service units include the service's current main
           process identifier as "MainPID" (which is runtime state), and time settings are
           always exposed as properties ending in the "...USec" suffix even if a matching
           configuration options end in "...Sec", because microseconds is the normalized time
           unit used internally by the system and service manager.

NAME
       systemctl - Control the systemd system and service manager

SYNOPSIS

       systemctl [OPTIONS...] COMMAND [UNIT...]

DESCRIPTION
       systemctl may be used to introspect and control the state of the "systemd" system and
       service manager. Please refer to systemd(1) for an introduction into the basic concepts
       and functionality this tool manages.

COMMANDS
       The following commands are understood:

   Unit Commands (Introspection and Modification)
       list-units [PATTERN...]
           List units that systemd currently has in memory. This includes units that are either
>0;root@ubse: ~stemctl(1) line 1 (press h for help or q to quit)
root@ubse:~# fg
man systemctl
           some way, such as a crash, exiting with an error code or timing out. If the failed
           state is entered the cause will be logged for later reference.

       show [PATTERN...|JOB...]
           Show properties of one or more units, jobs, or the manager itself. If no argument is
           specified, properties of the manager will be shown. If a unit name is specified,
           properties of the unit are shown, and if a job ID is specified, properties of the job
           are shown. By default, empty properties are suppressed. Use --all to show those too.
           To select specific properties to show, use --property=. This command is intended to
           be used whenever computer-parsable output is required. Use status if you are looking
           for formatted human-readable output.

           Many properties shown by systemctl show map directly to configuration settings of the
           system and service manager and its unit files. Note that the properties shown by the
           command are generally more low-level, normalized versions of the original
           configuration settings and expose runtime state in addition to configuration. For
           example, properties shown for service units include the service's current main
           process identifier as "MainPID" (which is runtime state), and time settings are
           always exposed as properties ending in the "...USec" suffix even if a matching
           configuration options end in "...Sec", because microseconds is the normalized time
           unit used internally by the system and service manager.

           interface backing these properties, see org.freedesktop.systemd1(5).
 ESESCOBpage systemctl(1) line 233 (press h for help or q to quit)
       cat PATTERN...l(1) line 234 (press h for help or q to quit)
           Show backing files of one or more units. Prints the "fragment" and "drop-ins" (source
           files) of units. Each file is preceded by a comment which includes the file name.
           Note that this shows the contents of the backing files on disk, which may not match
           the system manager's understanding of these units if any unit files were updated on
           disk and the daemon-reload command wasn't issued since.

           Start (activate) one or more units specified on the command line.
 ESESCOBpage systemctl(1) line 279 (press h for help or q to quit)
           Note that unit glob patterns expand to names of units currently in memory. Units
           which are not active and are not in a failed state usually are not in memory, and
           will not be matched by any pattern. In addition, in case of instantiated units,
           systemd is often unaware of the instance name until the instance has been started.
           Therefore, using glob patterns with start has limited usefulness. Also, secondary
           alias names of units are not considered.p or q to quit)
 ESESCOBpage systemctl(1) line 286 (press h for help or q to quit)
           Option --all may be used to also operate on inactive units which are referenced by
           other loaded units. Note that this is not the same as operating on "all" possible
           units, because as the previous paragraph describes, such a list is ill-defined.
           Nevertheless, systemctl start --all GLOB may be useful if all the units that should
           match the pattern are pulled in by some target which is known to be loaded.
 ESESCOBpage systemctl(1) line 292 (press h for help or q to quit)
       stop PATTERN...(1) line 293 (press h for help or q to quit)
           Stop (deactivate) one or more units specified on the command line.
 ESESCOBpage systemctl(1) line 295 (press h for help or q to quit)
           This command will fail if the unit does not exist or if stopping of the unit is
           prohibited (see RefuseManualStop= in systemd.unit(5)). It will not fail if any of the
           commands configured to stop the unit (ExecStop=, etc.) fail, because the manager will
           still forcibly terminate the unit.or help or q to quit)
 ESESCOBpage systemctl(1) line 300 (press h for help or q to quit)
           If a unit that gets stopped can still be triggered by other units, a warning
           containing the names of the triggering units is shown.  --no-warn can be used to
           suppress the warning.03 (press h for help or q to quit)
 ESESCOBpage systemctl(1) line 304 (press h for help or q to quit)
       reload PATTERN...) line 305 (press h for help or q to quit)
           Asks all units listed on the command line to reload their configuration. Note that
           this will reload the service-specific configuration, not the unit configuration file
           of systemd. If you want systemd to reload the configuration file of a unit, use the
           daemon-reload command. In other words: for the example case of Apache, this will
           reload Apache's httpd.conf in the web server, not the apache.service systemd unit
           file.temctl(1) line 311 (press h for help or q to quit)
 ESESCOBpage systemctl(1) line 312 (press h for help or q to quit)
           This command should not be confused with the daemon-reload command.
 ESESCOBpage systemctl(1) line 314 (press h for help or q to quit)
       restart PATTERN... line 315 (press h for help or q to quit)

 ESESCOBpage systemctl(1) line 318 (press h for help or q to quit)
           Note that restarting a unit with this command does not necessarily flush out all of
           the unit's resources before it is started again. For example, the per-service file
           descriptor storage facility (see FileDescriptorStoreMax= in systemd.service(5)) will
           remain intact as long as the unit has a job pending, and is only cleared when the
           unit is fully stopped and no jobs are pending anymore. If it is intended that the
           file descriptor store is flushed out, too, during a restart operation an explicit
           systemctl stop command followed by systemctl start should be issued.

           Added in version 229.

       isolate UNIT
           Start the unit specified on the command line and its dependencies and stop all
           others, unless they have IgnoreOnIsolate=yes (see systemd.unit(5)). If a unit name
           with no extension is given, an extension of ".target" will be assumed.

           This command is dangerous, since it will immediately stop processes that are not
           enabled in the new target, possibly including the graphical environment or terminal
           you are currently using.

           Note that this operation is allowed only on units where AllowIsolate= is enabled. See
           systemd.unit(5) for details.
 Manual page systemctl(1) line 352 (press h for help or q to quit)
       kill PATTERN...
           Send a UNIX process signal to one or more processes of the unit. Use --kill-whom= to
           select which process to send the signal to. Use --signal= to select the signal to
           send. Combine with --kill-value= to enqueue a POSIX Realtime Signal with an
           associated value.

       clean PATTERN...
           Remove the configuration, state, cache, logs or runtime data of the specified units.
           Use --what= to select which kind of resource to remove. For service units this may be
           used to remove the directories configured with ConfigurationDirectory=,
           StateDirectory=, CacheDirectory=, LogsDirectory= and RuntimeDirectory=, see
           systemd.exec(5) for details. It may also be used to clear the file descriptor store
           as enabled via FileDescriptorStoreMax=, see systemd.service(5) for details. For timer
           units this may be used to clear out the persistent timestamp data if Persistent= is
           used and --what=state is selected, see systemd.timer(5). This command only applies to
           units that use either of these settings. If --what= is not specified, the cache and
           runtime data as well as the file descriptor store are removed (as these three types
           of resources are generally redundant and reproducible on the next invocation of the
           unit). Note that the specified units must be stopped to invoke this operation.

           Added in version 243.

       freeze PATTERN...
           Freeze one or more units specified on the command line using cgroup freezer

           Freezing the unit will cause all processes contained within the cgroup corresponding
           to the unit to be suspended. Being suspended means that unit's processes won't be
           scheduled to run on CPU until thawed. Note that this command is supported only on
           systems that use unified cgroup hierarchy. Unit is automatically thawed just before
           we execute a job against the unit, e.g. before the unit is stopped.

           Added in version 246.

       thaw PATTERN...
           Thaw (unfreeze) one or more units specified on the command line.

           This is the inverse operation to the freeze command and resumes the execution of
           processes in the unit's cgroup.

           Added in version 246.

       set-property UNIT PROPERTY=VALUE...h for help or q to quit)
           Set the specified unit properties at runtime where this is supported. This allows
           changing configuration parameter properties such as resource control settings at
           runtime. Not all properties may be changed at runtime, but many resource control
           settings (primarily those in systemd.resource-control(5)) may. The changes are
           applied immediately, and stored on disk for future boots, unless --runtime is passed,
           in which case the settings only apply until the next reboot. The syntax of the
           property assignment follows closely the syntax of assignments in unit files.

           Example: systemctl set-property foobar.service CPUWeight=200

           If the specified unit appears to be inactive, the changes will be only stored on disk
           as described previously hence they will be effective when the unit will be started.

           Note that this command allows changing multiple properties at the same time, which is
           preferable over setting them individually.

           Example: systemctl set-property foobar.service CPUWeight=200 MemoryMax=2G
           IPAccounting=yes

           Like with unit file configuration settings, assigning an empty setting usually resets
           a property to its defaults.

           Example: systemctl set-property avahi-daemon.service IPAddressDeny=

           Added in version 206.

       bind UNIT PATH [PATH]
           Bind-mounts a file or directory from the host into the specified unit's mount
           namespace. The first path argument is the source file or directory on the host, the
           second path argument is the destination file or directory in the unit's mount
           namespace. When the latter is omitted, the destination path in the unit's mount
           namespace is the same as the source path on the host. When combined with the
           --read-only switch, a ready-only bind mount is created. When combined with the
           --mkdir switch, the destination path is first created before the mount is applied.

           Note that this option is currently only supported for units that run within a mount
           namespace (e.g.: with RootImage=, PrivateMounts=, etc.). This command supports
           bind-mounting directories, regular files, device nodes, AF_UNIX socket nodes, as well
           as FIFOs. The bind mount is ephemeral, and it is undone as soon as the current unit
           process exists. Note that the namespace mentioned here, where the bind mount will be
           added to, is the one where the main service process runs. Other processes (those
           exececuted by ExecReload=, ExecStartPre=, etc.) run in distinct namespaces.

           If supported by the kernel, any prior mount on the selected target will be replaced
           by the new mount. If not supported, any prior mount will be over-mounted, but remain
           pinned and inaccessible.

           Added in version 248.

       mount-image UNIT IMAGE [PATH [PARTITION_NAME:MOUNT_OPTIONS]]
           Mounts an image from the host into the specified unit's mount namespace. The first
           path argument is the source image on the host, the second path argument is the
           destination directory in the unit's mount namespace (i.e. inside
           RootImage=/RootDirectory=). The following argument, if any, is interpreted as a
           colon-separated tuple of partition name and comma-separated list of mount options for
           that partition. The format is the same as the service MountImages= setting. When
           combined with the --read-only switch, a ready-only mount is created. When combined
           with the --mkdir switch, the destination path is first created before the mount is
           applied.

           Note that this option is currently only supported for units that run within a mount
           namespace (i.e. with RootImage=, PrivateMounts=, etc.). Note that the namespace
           mentioned here where the image mount will be added to, is the one where the main
           service process runs. Note that the namespace mentioned here, where the bind mount
           will be added to, is the one where the main service process runs. Other processes
           (those exececuted by ExecReload=, ExecStartPre=, etc.) run in distinct namespaces.

           If supported by the kernel, any prior mount on the selected target will be replaced
           by the new mount. If not supported, any prior mount will be over-mounted, but remain
           pinned and inaccessible.(press h for help or q to quit)

           Example:

               systemctl mount-image foo.service /tmp/img.raw /var/lib/image root:ro,nosuid

               systemctl mount-image --mkdir bar.service /tmp/img.raw /var/lib/baz/img

           Added in version 248.

       service-log-level SERVICE [LEVEL]
           If the LEVEL argument is not given, print the current log level as reported by
           service SERVICE.

           If the optional argument LEVEL is provided, then change the current log level of the
           service to LEVEL. The log level should be a typical syslog log level, i.e. a value in
           the range 0...7 or one of the strings emerg, alert, crit, err, warning, notice, info,
           debug; see syslog(3) for details.

           The service must have the appropriate BusName=destination property and also implement
           the generic org.freedesktop.LogControl1(5) interface. (systemctl will use the generic
           D-Bus protocol to access the org.freedesktop.LogControl1.LogLevel interface for the
           D-Bus name destination.)

           Added in version 247.

       service-log-target SERVICE [TARGET]
           If the TARGET argument is not given, print the current log target as reported by
           If the optional argument LEVEL is provided, then change the current log level of the
           service to LEVEL. The log level should be a typical syslog log level, i.e. a value in

...skipping...
           List unit files installed on the system, in combination with their enablement state
           (as reported by is-enabled). If one or more PATTERNs are specified, only unit files
           whose name matches one of them are shown (patterns matching unit file system paths
           are not supported).

           Unlike list-units this command will list template units in addition to explicitly
           instantiated units.

           Added in version 233.

       enable UNIT..., enable PATH...
           Enable one or more units or unit instances. This will create a set of symlinks, as
           encoded in the [Install] sections of the indicated unit files. After the symlinks
           have been created, the system manager configuration is reloaded (in a way equivalent
           to daemon-reload), in order to ensure the changes are taken into account immediately.
           Note that this does not have the effect of also starting any of the units being
           enabled. If this is desired, combine this command with the --now switch, or invoke
           start with appropriate arguments later. Note that in case of unit instance enablement
           (i.e. enablement of units of the form foo@bar.service), symlinks named the same as
           instances are created in the unit configuration directory, however they point to the
           single template unit file they are instantiated from.

           This command expects either valid unit names (in which case various unit file
           directories are automatically searched for unit files with appropriate names), or
           absolute paths to unit files (in which case these files are read directly). If a
           specified unit file is located outside of the usual unit file directories, an
           additional symlink is created, linking it into the unit configuration path, thus
           ensuring it is found when requested by commands such as start. The file system where
           the linked unit files are located must be accessible when systemd is started (e.g.
           anything underneath /home/ or /var/ is not allowed, unless those directories are
           located on the root file system).

           This command will print the file system operations executed. This output may be
           suppressed by passing --quiet.

           Note that this operation creates only the symlinks suggested in the [Install] section
           of the unit files. While this command is the recommended way to manipulate the unit
           configuration directory, the administrator is free to make additional changes
           manually by placing or removing symlinks below this directory. This is particularly
           useful to create configurations that deviate from the suggested default installation.
           In this case, the administrator must make sure to invoke daemon-reload manually as
           necessary, in order to ensure the changes are taken into account.

           When using this operation on units without install information, a warning about it is
           shown.  --no-warn can be used to suppress the warning.

           Enabling units should not be confused with starting (activating) units, as done by
           the start command. Enabling and starting units is orthogonal: units may be enabled
           without being started and started without being enabled. Enabling simply hooks the
           unit into various suggested places (for example, so that the unit is automatically
           started on boot or when a particular kind of hardware is plugged in). Starting
           actually spawns the daemon process (in case of service units), or binds the socket
           (in case of socket units), and so on.
 Manual page systemctl(1) line 590 (press h for help or q to quit)
           Depending on whether --system, --user, --runtime, or --global is specified, this
           enables the unit for the system, for the calling user only, for only this boot of the
           system, or for all future logins of all users. Note that in the last case, no systemd
           daemon configuration is reloaded.

           Using enable on masked units is not supported and results in an error.

       disable UNIT...
           Disables one or more units. This removes all symlinks to the unit files backing the
           specified units from the unit configuration directory, and hence undoes any changes
           made by enable or link. Note that this removes all symlinks to matching unit files,
           including manually created symlinks, and not just those actually created by enable or
           link. Note that while disable undoes the effect of enable, the two commands are
           otherwise not symmetric, as disable may remove more symlinks than a prior enable
           invocation of the same unit created.

           This command expects valid unit names only, it does not accept paths to unit files.

           In addition to the units specified as arguments, all units are disabled that are
           listed in the Also= setting contained in the [Install] section of any of the unit
           files being operated on.

           This command implicitly reloads the system manager configuration after completing the
           operation. Note that this command does not implicitly stop the units that are being
           disabled. If this is desired, either combine this command with the --now switch, or
           invoke the stop command with appropriate arguments later.

           This command will print information about the file system operations (symlink
           removals) executed. This output may be suppressed by passing --quiet.

           If a unit gets disabled but its triggering units are still active, a warning
           containing the names of the triggering units is shown.  --no-warn can be used to
           suppress the warning.

           When this command is used with --user, the units being operated on might still be
           enabled in global scope, and thus get started automatically even after a successful
           disablement in user scope. In this case, a warning about it is shown, which can be
           suppressed using --no-warn.

           This command honors --system, --user, --runtime, --global and --no-warn in a similar
           way as enable.
 Manual page systemctl(1) line 632 (press h for help or q to quit)
           Added in version 238.

       reenable UNIT...
           Reenable one or more units, as specified on the command line. This is a combination
           of disable and enable and is useful to reset the symlinks a unit file is enabled with
           to the defaults configured in its [Install] section. This command expects a unit name
           only, it does not accept paths to unit files.

           Added in version 238.

       preset UNIT...
           Reset the enable/disable status one or more unit files, as specified on the command
           line, to the defaults configured in the preset policy files. This has the same effect

DESCRIPTIONe systemd.unit(5) line 19 (press h for help or q to quit)
       A unit file is a plain text ini-style file that encodes information about a service, a
       socket, a device, a mount point, an automount point, a swap file or partition, a start-up
       target, a watched file system path, a timer controlled and supervised by systemd(1), a
       resource management slice or a group of externally created processes. See
       systemd.syntax(7) for a general description of the syntax.it)

       In addition to the generic [Unit] and [Install] sections described here, each unit may
       have a type-specific section, e.g. [Service] for a service unit. See the respective man

       Unit names can be parameterized by a single argument called the "instance name". The unit
       is then constructed based on a "template file" which serves as the definition of multiple
       services or other units. A template unit must have a single "@" at the end of the unit
       name prefix (right before the type suffix). The name of the full unit is formed by
       inserting the instance name between "@" and the unit type suffix. In the unit file

SYSTEMD.SERVICE(5)                       systemd.service                      SYSTEMD.SERVICE(5)

NAME
       systemd.service - Service unit configuration

SYNOPSIS
       service.service

DESCRIPTION
       A unit configuration file whose name ends in ".service" encodes information about a
       process controlled and supervised by systemd.

       This man page lists the configuration options specific to this unit type. See
       systemd.unit(5) for the common options of all unit configuration files. The common
       configuration items are configured in the generic [Unit] and [Install] sections. The
       service specific configuration options are configured in the [Service] section.

       Additional options are listed in systemd.exec(5), which define the execution environment
       the commands are executed in, and in systemd.kill(5), which define the way the processes
       of the service are terminated, and in systemd.resource-control(5), which configure
       resource control settings for the processes of the service.uit)

       If SysV init compat is enabled, systemd automatically creates service units that wrap
       SysV init scripts (the service name is the same as the name of the script, with a
       ".service" suffix added); see systemd-sysv-generator(8).o quit)

       The systemd-run(1) command allows creating .service and .scope units dynamically and
       transiently from the command line.press h for help or q to quit)

SERVICE TEMPLATESemd.service(5) line 12 (press h for help or q to quit)
       It is possible for systemd services to take a single argument via the
       "service@argument.service" syntax. Such services are called "instantiated" services,
       while the unit definition without the argument parameter is called a "template". An
       example could be a dhcpcd@.service service template which takes a network interface as a
       parameter to form an instantiated service. Within the service file, this parameter or
       "instance name" can be accessed with %-specifiers. See systemd.unit(5) for details.

       Additional implicit dependencies may be added as result of execution and resource control
       parameters as documented in systemd.exec(5) and systemd.resource-control(5).

       The following dependencies are added unless DefaultDependencies=no is set:
 ESESCOBpage systemd.service(5) line 36 (press h for help or q to quit)
       â€¢   Service units will have dependencies of type Requires= and After= on sysinit.target,
           a dependency of type After= on basic.target as well as dependencies of type
           Conflicts= and Before= on shutdown.target. These ensure that normal service units
           pull in basic system initialization, and are terminated cleanly prior to system
           shutdown. Only services involved with early boot or late system shutdown should
           disable this option. line 42 (press h for help or q to quit)
 ESESCOBpage systemd.service(5) line 43 (press h for help or q to quit)
       â€¢   Instanced service units (i.e. service units with an "@" in their name) are assigned
           by default a per-template slice unit (see systemd.slice(5)), named after the template
           unit, containing all instances of the specific template. This slice is normally
           stopped at shutdown, together with all template instances. If that is not desired,
           set DefaultDependencies=no in the template unit, and either define your own
           per-template slice unit file that also sets DefaultDependencies=no, or set
           Slice=system.slice (or another suitable slice) in the template unit. Also see
           systemd.resource-control(5). (press h for help or q to quit)

       Service unit files may include [Unit] and [Install] sections, which are described in
       systemd.unit(5).rvice(5) line 55 (press h for help or q to quit)
 ESESCOBpage systemd.service(5) line 56 (press h for help or q to quit)
       Service unit files must include a [Service] section, which carries information about the
       service and the process it supervises. A number of options that may be used in this
       section are shared with other unit types. These options are documented in
       systemd.exec(5), systemd.kill(5) and systemd.resource-control(5). The options specific to
       the [Service] section of service units are the following:o quit)

       Type= systemd.service(5) line 63 (press h for help or q to quit)

 ESESCOBpage systemd.service(5) line 67 (press h for help or q to quit)
           â€¢   If set to simple (the default if ExecStart= is specified but neither Type= nor
               BusName= are), the service manager will consider the unit started immediately
               after the main service process has been forked off (i.e. immediately after
               fork(), and before various process attributes have been configured and in
               particular before the new process has called execve() to invoke the actual
               service binary). Typically, Type=exec is the better choice, see below.
 ESESCOBpage systemd.service(5) line 74 (press h for help or q to quit)
               It is expected that the process configured with ExecStart= is the main process of
               the service. In this mode, if the process offers functionality to other processes
               on the system, its communication channels should be installed before the service
               is started up (e.g. sockets set up by systemd, via socket activation), as the
               service manager will immediately proceed starting follow-up units, right after
               creating the main service process, and before executing the service's binary.
MESESCOApage systemd.service(5) line 81 (press h for help or q to quit)

M       the [Service] section of service units are the following: quit)
M       systemd.exec(5), systemd.kill(5) and systemd.resource-control(5). The options specific to
               is started up (e.g. sockets set up by systemd, via socket activation), as the
               service manager will immediately proceed starting follow-up units, right after
               creating the main service process, and before executing the service's binary.
               Note that this means systemctl start command lines for simple services will
               report success even if the service's binary cannot be invoked successfully (for
               example because the selected User= doesn't exist, or the service binary is
               missing).

           â€¢   The exec type is similar to simple, but the service manager will consider the
               unit started immediately after the main service binary has been executed. The
               service manager will delay starting of follow-up units until that point. (Or in
               other words: simple proceeds with further jobs right after fork() returns, while
               exec will not proceed before both fork() and execve() in the service process
               succeeded.) Note that this means systemctl start command lines for exec services
               will report failure when the service's binary cannot be invoked successfully (for
               example because the selected User= doesn't exist, or the service binary is
               missing).

           â€¢   If set to forking, the manager will consider the unit started immediately after
               the binary that forked off by the manager exits.  The use of this type is
               discouraged, use notify, notify-reload, or dbus instead.

               It is expected that the process configured with ExecStart= will call fork() as
               part of its start-up. The parent process is expected to exit when start-up is
               complete and all communication channels are set up. The child continues to run as
               the main service process, and the service manager will consider the unit started
               when the parent process exits. This is the behavior of traditional UNIX services.
               If this setting is used, it is recommended to also use the PIDFile= option, so
               that systemd can reliably identify the main process of the service. The manager
               will proceed with starting follow-up units after the parent process exits.

           â€¢   Behavior of oneshot is similar to simple; however, the service manager will
               consider the unit up after the main process exits. It will then start follow-up
               units.  RemainAfterExit= is particularly useful for this type of service.
               Type=oneshot is the implied default if neither Type= nor ExecStart= are
               specified. Note that if this option is used without RemainAfterExit= the service
               will never enter "active" unit state, but will directly transition from
               "activating" to "deactivating" or "dead", since no process is configured that
               shall run continuously. In particular this means that after a service of this
               type ran (and which has RemainAfterExit= not set) it will not show up as started
               afterwards, but as dead.

           â€¢   Behavior of dbus is similar to simple; however, units of this type must have the
               BusName= specified and the service manager will consider the unit up when the
               specified bus name has been acquired. This type is the default if BusName= is
               specified.

               Service units with this option configured implicitly gain dependencies on the
               dbus.socket unit. A service unit of this type is considered to be in the
               activating state until the specified bus name is acquired. It is considered
               activated while the bus name is taken. Once the bus name is released the service
               is considered being no longer functional which has the effect that the service
               manager attempts to terminate any remaining processes belonging to the service.
               Services that drop their bus name as part of their shutdown logic thus should be
               prepared to receive a SIGTERM (or whichever signal is configured in KillSignal=)
               as result.

           â€¢   Behavior of notify is similar to exec; however, it is expected that the service
               sends a "READY=1" notification message via sd_notify(3) or an equivalent call
               when it has finished starting up. systemd will proceed with starting follow-up
               units after this notification message has been sent. If this option is used,
               NotifyAccess= (see below) should be set to open access to the notification socket
               provided by systemd. If NotifyAccess= is missing or set to none, it will be
               forcibly set to main.

               If the service supports reloading, and uses a signal to start the reload, using
               notify-reload instead is recommended.

           â€¢   Behavior of notify-reload is similar to notify, with one difference: the SIGHUP
               UNIX process signal is sent to the service's main process when the service is
               asked to reload and the manager will wait for a notification about the reload
               being finished.
 Manual page systemd.service(5) line 150 (press h for help or q to quit)
               When initiating the reload process the service is expected to reply with a
               notification message via sd_notify(3) that contains the "RELOADING=1" field in
               combination with "MONOTONIC_USEC=" set to the current monotonic time (i.e.
               CLOCK_MONOTONIC in clock_gettime(2)) in Î¼s, formatted as decimal string. Once
               reloading is complete another notification message must be sent, containing
               "READY=1". Using this service type and implementing this reload protocol is an
               efficient alternative to providing an ExecReload= command for reloading of the
               service's configuration.

               The signal to send can be tweaked via ReloadSignal=, see below.

           â€¢   Behavior of idle is very similar to simple; however, actual execution of the
               service program is delayed until all active jobs are dispatched. This may be used
               to avoid interleaving of output of shell services with the status output on the
               console. Note that this type is useful only to improve console output, it is not
               useful as a general unit ordering tool, and the effect of this service type is
               subject to a 5s timeout, after which the service program is invoked anyway.
 Manual page systemd.service(5) line 168 (press h for help or q to quit)
           It is recommended to use Type=exec for long-running services, as it ensures that
           process setup errors (e.g. errors such as a missing service executable, or missing
           user) are properly tracked. However, as this service type won't propagate the
           failures in the service's own startup code (as opposed to failures in the preparatory
           steps the service manager executes before execve()) and doesn't allow ordering of
           other units against completion of initialization of the service code itself (which
           for example is useful if clients need to connect to the service through some form of
           IPC, and the IPC channel is only established by the service itself â€” in contrast to
           doing this ahead of time through socket or bus activation or similar), it might not
           be sufficient for many cases. If so, notify, notify-reload, or dbus (the latter only
           in case the service provides a D-Bus interface) are the preferred options as they
           allow service program code to precisely schedule when to consider the service started
           up successfully and when to proceed with follow-up units. The notify/notify-reload
           service types require explicit support in the service codebase (as sd_notify() or an
           equivalent API needs to be invoked by the service at the appropriate time) â€” if it's
           not supported, then forking is an alternative: it supports the traditional
           heavy-weight UNIX service start-up protocol. Note that using any type other than
           simple possibly delays the boot process, as the service manager needs to wait for at
           least some service initialization to complete. (Also note it is generally not
           recommended to use idle or oneshot for long-running services.)

           Note that various service settings (e.g.  User=, Group= through libc NSS) might
           result in "hidden" blocking IPC calls to other services when used. Sometimes it might
           be advisable to use the simple service type to ensure that the service manager's
           transaction logic is not affected by such potentially slow operations and hidden
           dependencies, as this is the only service type where the service manager will not
           wait for such service execution setup operations to complete before proceeding.

       ExitType=
           Specifies when the manager should consider the service to be finished. One of main or
           cgroup:

           â€¢   If set to main (the default), the service manager will consider the unit stopped
               when the main process, which is determined according to the Type=, exits.
               Consequently, it cannot be used with Type=oneshot.
 Manual page systemd.service(5) line 204 (press h for help or q to quit)
           â€¢   If set to cgroup, the service will be considered running as long as at least one
               process in the cgroup has not exited.

           It is generally recommended to use ExitType=main when a service has a known forking
           model and a main process can reliably be determined.  ExitType= cgroup is meant for
           applications whose forking model is not known ahead of time and which might not have
           a specific main process. It is well suited for transient or automatically generated
           services, such as graphical applications inside of a desktop environment.

           Added in version 250.

       RemainAfterExit=
           Takes a boolean value that specifies whether the service shall be considered active
           even when all its processes exited. Defaults to no.

       GuessMainPID=
           Takes a boolean value that specifies whether systemd should try to guess the main PID
           of a service if it cannot be determined reliably. This option is ignored unless
           Type=forking is set and PIDFile= is unset because for the other types or with an
           explicitly configured PID file, the main PID is always known. The guessing algorithm
           might come to incorrect conclusions if a daemon consists of more than one process. If
           the main PID cannot be determined, failure detection and automatic restarting of a
           service will not work reliably. Defaults to yes.

       PIDFile=
           Takes a path referring to the PID file of the service. Usage of this option is
           recommended for services where Type= is set to forking. The path specified typically
           points to a file below /run/. If a relative path is specified it is hence prefixed
           with /run/. The service manager will read the PID of the main process of the service
           from this file after start-up of the service. The service manager will not write to
           the file configured here, although it will remove the file after the service has shut
           down if it still exists. The PID file does not need to be owned by a privileged user,
           but if it is owned by an unprivileged user additional safety restrictions are
           enforced: the file may not be a symlink to a file owned by a different user (neither
           directly nor indirectly), and the PID file must refer to a process already belonging
           to the service.ce(5) line 240 (press h for help or q to quit)

           Note that PID files should be avoided in modern projects. Use Type=notify,
           Type=notify-reload or Type=simple where possible, which does not require use of PID
           files to determine the main process of a service and avoids needless forking.

       BusName=
           Takes a D-Bus destination name that this service shall use. This option is mandatory
           for services where Type= is set to dbus. It is recommended to always set this
           property if known to make it easy to map the service name to the D-Bus destination.
           In particular, systemctl service-log-level/service-log-target verbs make use of this.

       ExecStart=
           Commands that are executed when this service is started. The value is split into zero
           or more command lines according to the rules described in the section "Command Lines"
           below.

           Unless Type= is oneshot, exactly one command must be given. When Type=oneshot is
           used, zero or more commands may be specified. Commands may be specified by providing
           multiple command lines in the same directive, or alternatively, this directive may be
           specified more than once with the same effect. If the empty string is assigned to
           this option, the list of commands to start is reset, prior assignments of this option
           will have no effect. If no ExecStart= is specified, then the service must have
           RemainAfterExit=yes and at least one ExecStop= line set. (Services lacking both
           ExecStart= and ExecStop= are not valid.)

           If more than one command is specified, the commands are invoked sequentially in the
           order they appear in the unit file. If one of the commands fails (and is not prefixed
           with "-"), other lines are not executed, and the unit is considered failed.

           Unless Type=forking is set, the process started via this command line will be
           considered the main process of the daemon.

       ExecStartPre=, ExecStartPost=
           Additional commands that are executed before or after the command in ExecStart=,
           respectively. Syntax is the same as for ExecStart=, except that multiple command
