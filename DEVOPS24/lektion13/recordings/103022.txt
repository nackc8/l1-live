   [1m[7mBrace[27m[0m [1mExpansion[0m[m
       [4m[7mBrace[27m[24m [4mexpansion[24m is a mechanism by which arbitrary strings may be generated.  This  mecha‐[m
       nism  is similar to [4mpathname[24m [4mexpansion[24m, but the filenames generated need not exist.  Pat‐[m
       terns to be brace expanded take the form of an optional [4mpreamble[24m, followed  by  either  a[m
       series of comma-separated strings or a sequence expression between a pair of braces, fol‐[m
       lowed by an optional [4mpostscript[24m.  The preamble  is  prefixed  to  each  string  contained[m
       within  the braces, and the postscript is then appended to each resulting string, expand‐[m
       ing left to right.[m
[m
       [7mBrace[27m expansions may be nested.  The results of each expanded string are not sorted; left[m
       to right order is preserved.  For example, a[1m{[0md,c,b[1m}[0me expands into `ade ace abe'.[m
[m
       A sequence expression takes the form [1m{[0m[4mx[24m[1m..[0m[4my[24m[1m[..[0m[4mincr[24m[1m]}[0m, where [4mx[24m and [4my[24m are either integers or[m
       single letters, and [4mincr[24m, an optional increment, is an integer.  When integers  are  sup‐[m
       plied,  the expression expands to each number between [4mx[24m and [4my[24m, inclusive.  Supplied inte‐[m
       gers may be prefixed with [4m0[24m to force each term to have the same width.  When either [4mx[24m  or[m
       [4my[24m begins with a zero, the shell attempts to force all generated terms to contain the same[m
       number of digits, zero-padding where necessary.  When letters are supplied,  the  expres‐[m
       sion  expands  to  each character lexicographically between [4mx[24m and [4my[24m, inclusive, using the[m
       default C locale.  Note that both [4mx[24m and [4my[24m must be of the same type (integer  or  letter).[m
       When  the increment is supplied, it is used as the difference between each term.  The de‐[m
       fault increment is 1 or -1 as appropriate.[m
