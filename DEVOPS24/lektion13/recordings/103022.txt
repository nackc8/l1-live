       [4m[7mBrace[27m[24m [4mexpansion[24m is a mechanism by which arbitrary strings may be generated.  This  mecha‐[m
       nism  is similar to [4mpathname[24m [4mexpansion[24m, but the filenames generated need not exist.  Pat‐[m
       terns to be brace expanded take the form of an optional [4mpreamble[24m, followed  by  either  a[m
       series of comma-separated strings or a sequence expression between a pair of braces, fol‐[m
       lowed by an optional [4mpostscript[24m.  The preamble  is  prefixed  to  each  string  contained[m
       within  the braces, and the postscript is then appended to each resulting string, expand‐[m
       ing left to right.[m
[m
       [7mBrace[27m expansions may be nested.  The results of each expanded string are not sorted; left[m
       to right order is preserved.  For example, a[1m{[0md,c,b[1m}[0me expands into `ade ace abe'.[m
[m
       A sequence expression takes the form [1m{[0m[4mx[24m[1m..[0m[4my[24m[1m[..[0m[4mincr[24m[1m]}[0m, where [4mx[24m and [4my[24m are either integers or[m
       single letters, and [4mincr[24m, an optional increment, is an integer.  When integers  are  sup‐[m
       plied,  the expression expands to each number between [4mx[24m and [4my[24m, inclusive.  Supplied inte‐[m
       gers may be prefixed with [4m0[24m to force each term to have the same width.  When either [4mx[24m  or[m
       [4my[24m begins with a zero, the shell attempts to force all generated terms to contain the same[m
       number of digits, zero-padding where necessary.  When letters are supplied,  the  expres‐[m
       sion  expands  to  each character lexicographically between [4mx[24m and [4my[24m, inclusive, using the[m
       default C locale.  Note that both [4mx[24m and [4my[24m must be of the same type (integer  or  letter).[m
       When  the increment is supplied, it is used as the difference between each term.  The de‐[m

       [7mBrace[27m expansions may be nested.  The results of each expanded string are not sorted; left[m

       A sequence expression takes the form [1m{[0m[4mx[24m[1m..[0m[4my[24m[1m[..[0m[4mincr[24m[1m]}[0m, where [4mx[24m and [4my[24m are either integers or[m
       single letters, and [4mincr[24m, an optional increment, is an integer.  When integers  are  sup‐[m
       plied,  the expression expands to each number between [4mx[24m and [4my[24m, inclusive.  Supplied inte‐[m
       gers may be prefixed with [4m0[24m to force each term to have the same width.  When either [4mx[24m  or[m
       [4my[24m begins with a zero, the shell attempts to force all generated terms to contain the same[m
       number of digits, zero-padding where necessary.  When letters are supplied,  the  expres‐[m
       sion  expands  to  each character lexicographically between [4mx[24m and [4my[24m, inclusive, using the[m
       default C locale.  Note that both [4mx[24m and [4my[24m must be of the same type (integer  or  letter).[m
       When  the increment is supplied, it is used as the difference between each term.  The de‐[m
       fault increment is 1 or -1 as appropriate.[m

           List units that [1msystemd [22mcurrently has in memory. This includes units that are either[m
           referenced directly or through a dependency, units that are pinned by applications[m
[7m Manual page systemctl(1) line 1 (press h for help or q to quit)[27m[K[K           programmatically, or units that were active in the past and have failed. By default[m
           only units which are active, have pending jobs, or have failed are shown; this can be[m
           changed with option [1m--all[22m. If one or more [4mPATTERN[24ms are specified, only units matching[m
           one of them are shown. The units that are shown are additionally filtered by [1m--type=[0m[m
           and [1m--state= [22mif those options are specified.[m
[m
           Note that this command does not show unit templates, but only instances of unit[m
           templates. Units templates that aren't instantiated are not runnable, and will thus[m
           never show up in the output of this command. Specifically this means that[m
           foo@.service will never be shown in this list — unless instantiated, e.g. as[m
           foo@bar.service. Use [1mlist-unit-files [22m(see below) for listing installed unit template[m

[m
[1mDESCRIPTION[0m[m
       [1msystemctl [22mmay be used to introspect and control the state of the "systemd" system and[m
       service manager. Please refer to [1msystemd[22m(1) for an introduction into the basic concepts[m
       and functionality this tool manages.[m

       The following commands are understood:[m

           List units that [1msystemd [22mcurrently has in memory. This includes units that are either[m
[7m Manual page systemctl(1) line 1 (press h for help or q to quit)[27m[K[K           referenced directly or through a dependency, units that are pinned by applications[m
           programmatically, or units that were active in the past and have failed. By default[m
           only units which are active, have pending jobs, or have failed are shown; this can be[m
           changed with option [1m--all[22m. If one or more [4mPATTERN[24ms are specified, only units matching[m
           one of them are shown. The units that are shown are additionally filtered by [1m--type=[0m[m
           and [1m--state= [22mif those options are specified.[m
[m
           Note that this command does not show unit templates, but only instances of unit[m
           templates. Units templates that aren't instantiated are not runnable, and will thus[m
           never show up in the output of this command. Specifically this means that[m
           foo@.service will never be shown in this list — unless instantiated, e.g. as[m

           Show properties of one or more units, jobs, or the manager itself. If no argument is[m
           specified, properties of the manager will be shown. If a unit name is specified,[m
           properties of the unit are shown, and if a job ID is specified, properties of the job[m
           are shown. By default, empty properties are suppressed. Use [1m--all [22mto show those too.[m
           To select specific properties to show, use [1m--property=[22m. This command is intended to[m
           be used whenever computer-parsable output is required. Use [1mstatus [22mif you are looking[m
           for formatted human-readable output.[m
[m
           Many properties shown by [1msystemctl show [22mmap directly to configuration settings of the[m
           system and service manager and its unit files. Note that the properties shown by the[m
           command are generally more low-level, normalized versions of the original[m
           configuration settings and expose runtime state in addition to configuration. For[m
           example, properties shown for service units include the service's current main[m
           process identifier as "MainPID" (which is runtime state), and time settings are[m
           always exposed as properties ending in the "...USec" suffix even if a matching[m
           configuration options end in "...Sec", because microseconds is the normalized time[m

           settings (primarily those in [1msystemd.resource-control[22m(5)) may. The changes are[m

           Mounts an image from the host into the specified unit's mount namespace. The first[m

           [1mRootImage=[22m/[1mRootDirectory=[22m). The following argument, if any, is interpreted as a[m

[7m Manual page systemctl(1) line 450 (press h for help or q to quit)[27m[K[K           that partition. The format is the same as the service [1mMountImages= [22msetting. When[m
           combined with the [1m--read-only [22mswitch, a ready-only mount is created. When combined[m

[m
           Note that this option is currently only supported for units that run within a mount[m

           mentioned here where the image mount will be added to, is the one where the main[m

[7m Manual page systemctl(1) line 576 (press h for help or q to quit)[27m[K[K           useful to create configurations that deviate from the suggested default installation.[m

           necessary, in order to ensure the changes are taken into account.[m
[m

           Enabling units should not be confused with starting (activating) units, as done by[m

           without being started and started without being [7menable[27md. Enabling simply hooks the[m
           unit into various suggested places (for example, so that the unit is automatically[m
           started on boot or when a particular kind of hardware is plugged in). Starting[m
           actually spawns the daemon process (in case of service units), or binds the socket[m

               When initiating the reload process the service is expected to reply with a[m

               to avoid interleaving of output of shell services with the status output on the[m
               console. Note that this type is useful only to improve console output, it is not[m
               useful as a general unit ordering tool, and the effect of this service type is[m

           It is recommended to use [4mType=[24m[1mexec [22mfor long-running services, as it ensures that[m
           process setup errors (e.g. errors such as a missing service executable, or missing[m
           user) are properly tracked. However, as this service type won't propagate the[m
           failures in the service's own startup code (as opposed to failures in the preparatory[m
           steps the service manager executes before [1mexecve()[22m) and doesn't allow ordering of[m
           other units against completion of initialization of the service code itself (which[m
           for example is useful if clients need to connect to the service through some form of[m
           IPC, and the IPC channel is only established by the service itself — in contrast to[m
           doing this ahead of time through socket or bus activation or similar), it might not[m
           be sufficient for many cases. If so, [1mnotify[22m, [1mnotify-reload[22m, or [1mdbus [22m(the latter only[m
           in case the service provides a D-Bus interface) are the preferred options as they[m
           allow service program code to precisely schedule when to consider the service started[m
           up successfully and when to proceed with follow-up units. The [1mnotify[22m/[1mnotify-reload[0m[m
           service types require explicit support in the service codebase (as [1msd_notify() [22mor an[m
           equivalent API needs to be invoked by the service at the appropriate time) — if it's[m
           not supported, then [1mforking [22mis an alternative: it supports the traditional[m
           heavy-weight UNIX service start-up protocol. Note that using any type other than[m

[7m Manual page systemd.service(5) line 222 (press h for help or q to quit)[27m[K[K           of a service if it cannot be determined reliably. This option is ignored unless[m

           might come to incorrect conclusions if a daemon consists of more than one process. If[m

[m
       [4mPIDFile=[0m[m
           Takes a path referring to the PID file of the service. Usage of this option is[m
           recommended for services where [4mType=[24m is set to [1mforking[22m. The path specified typically[m
           points to a file below /run/. If a relative path is specified it is hence prefixed[m
           with /run/. The service manager will read the PID of the main process of the service[m
           from this file after start-up of the service. The service manager will not write to[m
           the file configured here, although it will remove the file after the service has shut[m
           down if it still exists. The PID file does not need to be owned by a privileged user,[m
           but if it is owned by an unprivileged user additional safety restrictions are[m
           enforced: the file may not be a symlink to a file owned by a different user (neither[m
           directly nor indirectly), and the PID file must refer to a process already belonging[m

[m
           Note that PID files should be avoided in modern projects. Use [1mType=notify[22m,[m
           [1mType=notify-reload [22mor [1mType=simple [22mwhere possible, which does not require use of PID[m

           property if known to make it easy to map the service name to the D-Bus destination.[m
