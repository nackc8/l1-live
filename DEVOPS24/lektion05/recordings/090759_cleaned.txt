$ DEVOPS24/lektion5/tillbakablickL4
$ help cd
cd: cd [-L|[-P [-e]] [-@]] [dir]
    Change the shell working directory.
    
    Change the current directory to DIR.  The default DIR is the value of the
    HOME shell variable. If DIR is "-", it is converted to $OLDPWD.
    
    The variable CDPATH defines the search path for the directory containing
    DIR.  Alternative directory names in CDPATH are separated by a colon (:).
    A null directory name is the same as the current directory.  If DIR begins
    with a slash (/), then CDPATH is not used.
    
    If the directory is not found, and the shell option `cdable_vars' is set,
    the word is assumed to be  a variable name.  If that variable has a value,
    its value is used for DIR.
    
    Options:
      -L	force symbolic links to be followed: resolve symbolic
    		links in DIR after processing instances of `..'
      -P	use the physical directory structure without following
    		symbolic links: resolve symbolic links in DIR before
    		processing instances of `..'
      -e	if the -P option is supplied, and the current working
    		directory cannot be determined successfully, exit with
    		a non-zero status
      -@	on systems that support it, present a file with extended
    		attributes as a directory containing the file attributes
    
    The default is to follow symbolic links, as if `-L' were specified.
    `..' is processed by removing the immediately previous pathname component
    back to a slash or the beginning of DIR.
    
    Exit Status:
    Returns 0 if the directory is changed, and if $PWD is set successfully when
    -P is used; non-zero otherwise.

       All of the single-character shell options documented in the description
       of the set builtin command, including -o, can be used as  options  when
       the  shell  is invoked.  In addition, bash interprets the following op‐
       tions when it is invoked:ss h for help or q to quit)
 ESESCOBpage bash(1) line 8 (press h for help or q to quit)
       -c        If the -c option is present, then commands are read from  the
                 first non-option argument command_string.  If there are argu‐
                 ments after the command_string, the  first  argument  is  as‐
                 signed  to $0 and any remaining arguments are assigned to the
                 positional parameters.  The assignment to $0 sets the name of
                 the shell, which is used in warning and error messages.
       -i        If the -i option is present, the shell is interactive.

       -s        If  the -s option is present, or if no arguments remain after
                 option processing, then commands are read from  the  standard
                 input.   This  option  allows the positional parameters to be
                 set when invoking an interactive shell or when reading  input
                 through a pipe.ess h for help or q to quit)

       -x        Print commands and their arguments as they are executed.
       -D        A  list of all double-quoted strings preceded by $ is printed
                 on the standard output.  These are the strings that are  sub‐
                 ject to language translation when the current locale is not C
                 or POSIX.  This implies the -n option; no  commands  will  be
                 executed.31 (press h for help or q to quit)
       [-+]O [shopt_option]2 (press h for help or q to quit)
                 shopt_option  is  one  of  the  shell options accepted by the
                 shopt  builtin  (see  SHELL  BUILTIN  COMMANDS  below).    If
                 shopt_option is present, -O sets the value of that option; +O
                 unsets it.  If shopt_option is not supplied,  the  names  and
                 values  of the shell options accepted by shopt are printed on
                 the standard output.  If the invocation  option  is  +O,  the
                 output is displayed in a format that may be reused as input.
       --        A  --  signals the end of options and disables further option
                 processing.  Any arguments after the -- are treated as  file‐
                 names and arguments.  An argument of - is equivalent to --.

       Bash  also  interprets  a number of multi-character options.  These op‐
       tions must appear on the command line before the  single-character  op‐
       tions to be recognized.press h for help or q to quit)

       If arguments remain after option processing, and neither the -c nor the
       -s  option  has  been supplied, the first argument is assumed to be the
       name of a file containing shell commands.  If bash is invoked  in  this
       fashion,  $0 is set to the name of the file, and the positional parame‐
       ters are set to the remaining arguments.  Bash reads and executes  com‐
       mands  from this file, then exits.  Bash's exit status is the exit sta‐
       tus of the last command executed in the script.  If no commands are ex‐
       ecuted,  the  exit  status  is 0.  An attempt is first made to open the
       file in the current directory, and, if no file is found, then the shell
       searches the directories in PATH for the script. quit)

       When bash is invoked as an interactive login shell, or as a  non-inter‐
       active  shell with the --login option, it first reads and executes com‐
       mands from the file /etc/profile, if that file exists.   After  reading
       that file, it looks for ~/.bash_profile, ~/.bash_login, and ~/.profile,
       in that order, and reads and executes commands from the first one  that
       exists  and  is  readable.  The --noprofile option may be used when the
       shell is started to inhibit this behavior.r q to quit)
 ESESCOBpage bash(1) line 136 (press h for help or q to quit)
       When an interactive login shell exits, or a non-interactive login shell

 ESESCOBpage bash(1) line 140 (press h for help or q to quit)
       When an interactive shell that is not a login shell  is  started,  bash
       reads  and  executes  commands  from /etc/bash.bashrc and ~/.bashrc, if
       these files exist.  This may be inhibited by using the  --norc  option.
       The  --rcfile  file option will force bash to read and execute commands
       from file instead of /etc/bash.bashrc and ~/.bashrc.t)
 ESESCOBpage bash(1) line 146 (press h for help or q to quit)
       When bash is started non-interactively, to run a shell script, for  ex‐
       ample,  it  looks for the variable BASH_ENV in the environment, expands
       its value if it appears there, and uses the expanded value as the  name
       of  a  file to read and execute.  Bash behaves as if the following com‐
       mand were executed:151 (press h for help or q to quit)
              if [ -n "$BASH_ENV" ]; then . "$BASH_ENV"; fit)
       but the value of the PATH variable is not used to search for the  file‐
       name. bash(1) line 154 (press h for help or q to quit)
 ESESCOBpage bash(1) line 155 (press h for help or q to quit)
       If  bash is invoked with the name sh, it tries to mimic the startup be‐
       havior of historical versions of sh as closely as possible, while  con‐
       forming  to the POSIX standard as well.  When invoked as an interactive
       login shell, or a non-interactive shell with  the  --login  option,  it
       first  attempts  to  read  and  execute  commands from /etc/profile and
       ~/.profile, in that order.  The --noprofile option may be used  to  in‐
       hibit  this  behavior.   When  invoked as an interactive shell with the
       name sh, bash looks for the variable ENV, expands its value  if  it  is
       defined,  and uses the expanded value as the name of a file to read and
       execute.  Since a shell invoked as sh does not attempt to read and exe‐
       cute  commands from any other startup files, the --rcfile option has no
       effect.  A non-interactive shell invoked with the name sh does not  at‐
       tempt to read any other startup files.  When invoked as sh, bash enters
       posix mode after the startup files are read.q to quit)
 ESESCOBpage bash(1) line 170 (press h for help or q to quit)
       When bash is started in posix mode, as with the  --posix  command  line
       option, it follows the POSIX standard for startup files.  In this mode,
       interactive shells expand the ENV variable and commands  are  read  and
       executed  from  the  file  whose  name is the expanded value.  No other
       startup files are read.(press h for help or q to quit)
 ESESCOBpage bash(1) line 176 (press h for help or q to quit)
       Bash attempts to determine when it is being run with its standard input
       connected  to  a network connection, as when executed by the historical
       remote shell daemon, usually rshd, or the secure shell daemon sshd.  If
       bash  determines  it is being run non-interactively in this fashion, it
       reads and executes commands from  /etc/bash.bashrc  and  ~/.bashrc,  if
       these  files exist and are readable.  It will not do this if invoked as
       sh.  The --norc option may be used to inhibit this  behavior,  and  the
       --rcfile  option may be used to force another file to be read, but nei‐
       ther rshd nor sshd generally invoke the shell with those options or al‐
       low them to be specified.ress h for help or q to quit)
 ESESCOBpage bash(1) line 187 (press h for help or q to quit)

       A  simple  command  is a sequence of optional variable assignments fol‐
       lowed by blank-separated words and redirections, and  terminated  by  a
       control operator.  The first word specifies the command to be executed,

   Pipelines bash(1) line 238 (press h for help or q to quit)
       A pipeline is a sequence of one or more commands separated  by  one  of
       the control operators | or |&.  The format for a pipeline is:
 ESESCOBpage bash(1) line 241 (press h for help or q to quit)
              [time [-p]] [ ! ] command1 [ [|⎪|&] command2 ... ]
 ESESCOBpage bash(1) line 243 (press h for help or q to quit)
       The standard output of command1 is connected via a pipe to the standard
       input of command2.  This connection is performed  before  any  redirec‐
       tions specified by the command1(see REDIRECTION below).  If |& is used,
       command1's standard error, in addition to its standard output, is  con‐
       nected  to  command2's standard input through the pipe; it is shorthand
       for 2>&1 |.  This implicit redirection of the  standard  error  to  the
       standard  output  is performed after any redirections specified by com‐
       mand1.bash(1) line 251 (press h for help or q to quit)
 ESESCOBpage bash(1) line 252 (press h for help or q to quit)
       The return status of a pipeline is the exit status of the last command,
       unless  the  pipefail  option  is enabled.  If pipefail is enabled, the
       pipeline's return status is the value of the last  (rightmost)  command
       to  exit  with a non-zero status, or zero if all commands exit success‐
       fully.  If the reserved word !  precedes a pipeline, the exit status of
       that  pipeline  is the logical negation of the exit status as described
       above.  The shell waits for all commands in the pipeline  to  terminate
       before returning a value.ress h for help or q to quit)
 ESESCOBpage bash(1) line 261 (press h for help or q to quit)
       If  the  time reserved word precedes a pipeline, the elapsed as well as
       user and system time consumed by its execution are  reported  when  the
       pipeline  terminates.   The -p option changes the output format to that
       specified by POSIX.  When the shell is in posix mode, it does not  rec‐
       ognize  time  as  a  reserved word if the next token begins with a `-'.
       The TIMEFORMAT variable may be set to a format  string  that  specifies
       how  the timing information should be displayed; see the description of
       TIMEFORMAT under Shell Variables below.p or q to quit)
 ESESCOBpage bash(1) line 270 (press h for help or q to quit)
       When the shell is in posix mode, time may be followed by a newline.  In
       this  case,  the shell displays the total user and system time consumed

       specify the format of the time information. q to quit)

       When the == and != operators are used, the string to the right  of  the
       operator is considered a pattern and matched according to the rules de‐
       scribed below under Pattern Matching, as if the  extglob  shell  option
       were  enabled.  The = operator is equivalent to ==.  If the nocasematch
       shell option is enabled, the match is performed without regard  to  the
       case  of  alphabetic  characters.   The return value is 0 if the string
       matches (==) or does not match (!=) the pattern, and 1 otherwise.   Any
       part  of  the  pattern  may be quoted to force the quoted portion to be
       matched as a string.76 (press h for help or q to quit)
 ESESCOBpage bash(1) line 377 (press h for help or q to quit)
       An additional binary operator, =~, is available, with the  same  prece‐
       dence  as  ==  and !=.  When it is used, the string to the right of the
       operator is considered a POSIX extended regular expression and  matched
       accordingly (using the POSIX regcomp and regexec interfaces usually de‐
       scribed in regex(3)).  The return value is 0 if the string matches  the
       pattern,  and  1 otherwise.  If the regular expression is syntactically
       incorrect, the conditional expression's return value is 2.  If the  no‐
       casematch  shell  option is enabled, the match is performed without re‐
       gard to the case of alphabetic characters.  If any part of the  pattern
       is  quoted,  the quoted portion is matched literally.  This means every
       character in the quoted portion matches itself, instead of  having  any
       special  pattern matching meaning.  If the pattern is stored in a shell
       variable, quoting the variable expansion forces the entire  pattern  to
       be matched literally.  Treat bracket expressions in regular expressions
       carefully, since normal quoting and pattern characters lose their mean‐
       ings between brackets. (press h for help or q to quit)
 ESESCOBpage bash(1) line 394 (press h for help or q to quit)
       The  pattern  will  match if it matches any part of the string.  Anchor
       the pattern using the ^ and $ regular expression operators to force  it
       to  match  the  entire string.  The array variable BASH_REMATCH records
       which parts of the string matched the pattern.  The element of BASH_RE‐
       MATCH  with index 0 contains the portion of the string matching the en‐
       tire regular expression.  Substrings matched  by  parenthesized  subex‐
       pressions  within  the  regular  expression  are saved in the remaining
       BASH_REMATCH indices. The element of BASH_REMATCH with index n  is  the
       portion  of  the  string  matching the nth parenthesized subexpression.
       Bash sets BASH_REMATCH in the global scope; declaring  it  as  a  local

              The while command continuously executes the list list-2 as  long
              as the last command in the list list-1 returns an exit status of
              zero.  The until command is identical to the while command,  ex‐
              cept that the test is negated: list-2 is executed as long as the
              last command in list-1 returns a non-zero exit status.  The exit
              status of the while and until commands is the exit status of the
              last command executed in list-2, or zero if none was executed.

       A coprocess is a shell command preceded by the coproc reserved word.  A
       coprocess  is  executed asynchronously in a subshell, as if the command
       had been terminated with the & control operator, with  a  two-way  pipe
       established between the executing shell and the coprocess.

              compound command are not tested, and are added  to  the  history
              regardless of the value of HISTCONTROL.
       HISTFILE
              The name of the file in which command history is saved (see HIS‐

              The maximum number of lines contained in the history file.  When
              this variable is assigned a value, the  history  file  is  trun‐

              truncated  to this size after writing it when a shell exits.  If
              the value is 0, the history file  is  truncated  to  zero  size.
              Non-numeric  values  and  numeric  values less than zero inhibit

              FILE exists and the user has write access

       -x FILE
              FILE exists and the user has execute (or search) access

       Except for -h and  -L,  all  FILE-related  tests  dereference  symbolic
       links.   Beware  that  parentheses  need  to be escaped (e.g., by back‐
       slashes) for shells.  INTEGER may also be -l STRING, which evaluates to
       the length of STRING.

       NOTE:  Binary  -a  and -o are inherently ambiguous.  Use 'test EXPR1 &&
       test EXPR2' or 'test EXPR1 || test EXPR2' instead.

       NOTE: [ honors the --help and --version options,  but  test  does  not.
       test treats each of those as it treats any other nonempty STRING.

help read
read: read [-ers] [-a array] [-d delim] [-i text] [-n nchars] [-N nchars] [-p prompt] [-t timeout] [-u fd] [name ...]
    Read a line from the standard input and split it into fields.
    
    Reads a single line from the standard input, or from file descriptor FD
    if the -u option is supplied.  The line is split into fields as with word
    splitting, and the first word is assigned to the first NAME, the second
    word to the second NAME, and so on, with any leftover words assigned to
    the last NAME.  Only the characters found in $IFS are recognized as word
    delimiters. By default, the backslash character escapes delimiter characters
    and newline.
    
    If no NAMEs are supplied, the line read is stored in the REPLY variable.
    
    Options:
      -a array	assign the words read to sequential indices of the array
    		variable ARRAY, starting at zero
      -d delim	continue until the first character of DELIM is read, rather
    		than newline
      -e	use Readline to obtain the line
      -i text	use TEXT as the initial text for Readline
      -n nchars	return after reading NCHARS characters rather than waiting
    		for a newline, but honor a delimiter if fewer than
    		NCHARS characters are read before the delimiter
      -N nchars	return only after reading exactly NCHARS characters, unless
    		EOF is encountered or read times out, ignoring any
    		delimiter
      -p prompt	output the string PROMPT without a trailing newline before
    		attempting to read
      -r	do not allow backslashes to escape any characters
      -s	do not echo input coming from a terminal
      -t timeout	time out and return failure if a complete line of
    		input is not read within TIMEOUT seconds.  The value of the
    		TMOUT variable is the default timeout.  TIMEOUT may be a
    		fractional number.  If TIMEOUT is 0, read returns
    		immediately, without trying to read any data, returning
    		success only if input is available on the specified
    		file descriptor.  The exit status is greater than 128
    		if the timeout is exceeded
      -u fd	read from file descriptor FD instead of the standard input
    
    Exit Status:
    The return code is zero, unless end-of-file is encountered, read times out
    (in which case it's greater than 128), a variable assignment error occurs,
    or an invalid file descriptor is supplied as the argument to -u.

BASH(1)                     General Commands Manual                    BASH(1)

NAME
       bash - GNU Bourne-Again SHell

SYNOPSIS
       bash [options] [command_string | file]

COPYRIGHT
       Bash is Copyright (C) 1989-2022 by the Free Software Foundation, Inc.

DESCRIPTION
       Bash  is  an  sh-compatible  command language interpreter that executes
       commands read from the standard input or from a file.  Bash also incor‐
       porates useful features from the Korn and C shells (ksh and csh).

       Bash  is  intended  to  be a conformant implementation of the Shell and
       Utilities portion  of  the  IEEE  POSIX  specification  (IEEE  Standard
       1003.1).  Bash can be configured to be POSIX-conformant by default.
 ESESCOBpage bash(1) line 4 (press h for help or q to quit)
OPTIONSBpage bash(1) line 5 (press h for help or q to quit)
       All of the single-character shell options documented in the description
       of the set builtin command, including -o, can be used as  options  when
       the  shell  is invoked.  In addition, bash interprets the following op‐
       tions when it is invoked:ss h for help or q to quit)
 ESESCOBpage bash(1) line 10 (press h for help or q to quit)
       -c        If the -c option is present, then commands are read from  the
                 first non-option argument command_string.  If there are argu‐
                 ments after the command_string, the  first  argument  is  as‐
                 signed  to $0 and any remaining arguments are assigned to the
                 positional parameters.  The assignment to $0 sets the name of
                 the shell, which is used in warning and error messages.
       -i        If the -i option is present, the shell is interactive.
       -l        Make bash act as if it had been invoked as a login shell (see
                 INVOCATION below). h for help or q to quit)
       -r        If the -r option is present,  the  shell  becomes  restricted
                 (see RESTRICTED SHELL below). or q to quit)
       -s        If  the -s option is present, or if no arguments remain after
                 option processing, then commands are read from  the  standard
                 input.   This  option  allows the positional parameters to be
                 set when invoking an interactive shell or when reading  input
                 through a pipe.ess h for help or q to quit)
       -v        Print shell input lines as they are read.t)
       -x        Print commands and their arguments as they are executed.
       -D        A  list of all double-quoted strings preceded by $ is printed
                 on the standard output.  These are the strings that are  sub‐
                 ject to language translation when the current locale is not C
                 or POSIX.  This implies the -n option; no  commands  will  be
                 executed.33 (press h for help or q to quit)
       [-+]O [shopt_option]4 (press h for help or q to quit)
                 shopt_option  is  one  of  the  shell options accepted by the
                 shopt  builtin  (see  SHELL  BUILTIN  COMMANDS  below).    If
                 shopt_option is present, -O sets the value of that option; +O
                 unsets it.  If shopt_option is not supplied,  the  names  and
                 values  of the shell options accepted by shopt are printed on
                 the standard output.  If the invocation  option  is  +O,  the
                 output is displayed in a format that may be reused as input.
       --        A  --  signals the end of options and disables further option
                 processing.  Any arguments after the -- are treated as  file‐
                 names and arguments.  An argument of - is equivalent to --.
 ESESCOBpage bash(1) line 45 (press h for help or q to quit)
       Bash  also  interprets  a number of multi-character options.  These op‐
       tions must appear on the command line before the  single-character  op‐
       tions to be recognized.press h for help or q to quit)

ARGUMENTSage bash(1) line 103 (press h for help or q to quit)
       If arguments remain after option processing, and neither the -c nor the
       -s  option  has  been supplied, the first argument is assumed to be the
       name of a file containing shell commands.  If bash is invoked  in  this
       fashion,  $0 is set to the name of the file, and the positional parame‐
       ters are set to the remaining arguments.  Bash reads and executes  com‐
       mands  from this file, then exits.  Bash's exit status is the exit sta‐
       tus of the last command executed in the script.  If no commands are ex‐
       ecuted,  the  exit  status  is 0.  An attempt is first made to open the
       file in the current directory, and, if no file is found, then the shell
       searches the directories in PATH for the script. quit)

       An interactive shell is one started without non-option  arguments  (un‐

       sion in the EXPANSION section.h for help or q to quit)
 ESESCOBpage bash(1) line 130 (press h for help or q to quit)
       When bash is invoked as an interactive login shell, or as a  non-inter‐
       active  shell with the --login option, it first reads and executes com‐
       mands from the file /etc/profile, if that file exists.   After  reading
       that file, it looks for ~/.bash_profile, ~/.bash_login, and ~/.profile,
       in that order, and reads and executes commands from the first one  that
       exists  and  is  readable.  The --noprofile option may be used when the
       shell is started to inhibit this behavior.r q to quit)
 ESESCOBpage bash(1) line 138 (press h for help or q to quit)
       When an interactive login shell exits, or a non-interactive login shell
       executes  the  exit  builtin  command, bash reads and executes commands
       from the file ~/.bash_logout, if it exists. q to quit)
 ESESCOBpage bash(1) line 142 (press h for help or q to quit)
       When an interactive shell that is not a login shell  is  started,  bash
       reads  and  executes  commands  from /etc/bash.bashrc and ~/.bashrc, if
       these files exist.  This may be inhibited by using the  --norc  option.
       The  --rcfile  file option will force bash to read and execute commands
       from file instead of /etc/bash.bashrc and ~/.bashrc.t)
 ESESCOBpage bash(1) line 148 (press h for help or q to quit)
       When bash is started non-interactively, to run a shell script, for  ex‐
       ample,  it  looks for the variable BASH_ENV in the environment, expands
       its value if it appears there, and uses the expanded value as the  name
       of  a  file to read and execute.  Bash behaves as if the following com‐
       mand were executed:153 (press h for help or q to quit)
              if [ -n "$BASH_ENV" ]; then . "$BASH_ENV"; fit)
       but the value of the PATH variable is not used to search for the  file‐
       name. bash(1) line 156 (press h for help or q to quit)
 ESESCOBpage bash(1) line 157 (press h for help or q to quit)
       If  bash is invoked with the name sh, it tries to mimic the startup be‐
       havior of historical versions of sh as closely as possible, while  con‐
       forming  to the POSIX standard as well.  When invoked as an interactive
       login shell, or a non-interactive shell with  the  --login  option,  it
       first  attempts  to  read  and  execute  commands from /etc/profile and
       ~/.profile, in that order.  The --noprofile option may be used  to  in‐
       hibit  this  behavior.   When  invoked as an interactive shell with the
       name sh, bash looks for the variable ENV, expands its value  if  it  is
       defined,  and uses the expanded value as the name of a file to read and
       execute.  Since a shell invoked as sh does not attempt to read and exe‐
       cute  commands from any other startup files, the --rcfile option has no
       effect.  A non-interactive shell invoked with the name sh does not  at‐
       tempt to read any other startup files.  When invoked as sh, bash enters
       posix mode after the startup files are read.q to quit)
 ESESCOBpage bash(1) line 172 (press h for help or q to quit)
       When bash is started in posix mode, as with the  --posix  command  line
       option, it follows the POSIX standard for startup files.  In this mode,
       interactive shells expand the ENV variable and commands  are  read  and
       executed  from  the  file  whose  name is the expanded value.  No other
       startup files are read.(press h for help or q to quit)
 ESESCOBpage bash(1) line 178 (press h for help or q to quit)
       Bash attempts to determine when it is being run with its standard input
       connected  to  a network connection, as when executed by the historical
       remote shell daemon, usually rshd, or the secure shell daemon sshd.  If
       bash  determines  it is being run non-interactively in this fashion, it
       reads and executes commands from  /etc/bash.bashrc  and  ~/.bashrc,  if
       these  files exist and are readable.  It will not do this if invoked as
       sh.  The --norc option may be used to inhibit this  behavior,  and  the
       --rcfile  option may be used to force another file to be read, but nei‐
       ther rshd nor sshd generally invoke the shell with those options or al‐
       low them to be specified.ress h for help or q to quit)
 ESESCOBpage bash(1) line 189 (press h for help or q to quit)
       If the shell is started with the effective user (group) id not equal to
       the real user (group) id, and the -p option is not supplied, no startup
       files are read, shell functions are not inherited from the environment,
       the SHELLOPTS, BASHOPTS, CDPATH, and GLOBIGNORE variables, if they  ap‐
       pear  in the environment, are ignored, and the effective user id is set
       to the real user id.  If the -p option is supplied at  invocation,  the
       startup behavior is the same, but the effective user id is not reset.

   Pipelines bash(1) line 240 (press h for help or q to quit)
       A pipeline is a sequence of one or more commands separated  by  one  of
       the control operators | or |&.  The format for a pipeline is:
 ESESCOBpage bash(1) line 243 (press h for help or q to quit)
              [time [-p]] [ ! ] command1 [ [|⎪|&] command2 ... ]
 ESESCOBpage bash(1) line 245 (press h for help or q to quit)
       The standard output of command1 is connected via a pipe to the standard
       input of command2.  This connection is performed  before  any  redirec‐
       tions specified by the command1(see REDIRECTION below).  If |& is used,
       command1's standard error, in addition to its standard output, is  con‐
       nected  to  command2's standard input through the pipe; it is shorthand
       for 2>&1 |.  This implicit redirection of the  standard  error  to  the
       standard  output  is performed after any redirections specified by com‐
       mand1.bash(1) line 253 (press h for help or q to quit)
 ESESCOBpage bash(1) line 254 (press h for help or q to quit)
       The return status of a pipeline is the exit status of the last command,

       shell option is enabled, the match is performed without regard  to  the
       case  of  alphabetic  characters.   The return value is 0 if the string
       matches (==) or does not match (!=) the pattern, and 1 otherwise.   Any

       accordingly (using the POSIX regcomp and regexec interfaces usually de‐
       scribed in regex(3)).  The return value is 0 if the string matches  the
       pattern,  and  1 otherwise.  If the regular expression is syntactically
       incorrect, the conditional expression's return value is 2.  If the  no‐
       casematch  shell  option is enabled, the match is performed without re‐
       gard to the case of alphabetic characters.  If any part of the  pattern
       is  quoted,  the quoted portion is matched literally.  This means every
       character in the quoted portion matches itself, instead of  having  any
       special  pattern matching meaning.  If the pattern is stored in a shell
       variable, quoting the variable expansion forces the entire  pattern  to
       be matched literally.  Treat bracket expressions in regular expressions

       An additional binary operator, =~, is available, with the  same  prece‐
       dence  as  ==  and !=.  When it is used, the string to the right of the
       operator is considered a POSIX extended regular expression and  matched
       accordingly (using the POSIX regcomp and regexec interfaces usually de‐
       scribed in regex(3)).  The return value is 0 if the string matches  the
       pattern,  and  1 otherwise.  If the regular expression is syntactically
       incorrect, the conditional expression's return value is 2.  If the  no‐
       casematch  shell  option is enabled, the match is performed without re‐
       gard to the case of alphabetic characters.  If any part of the  pattern
       is  quoted,  the quoted portion is matched literally.  This means every
       character in the quoted portion matches itself, instead of  having  any
       special  pattern matching meaning.  If the pattern is stored in a shell
       variable, quoting the variable expansion forces the entire  pattern  to
       be matched literally.  Treat bracket expressions in regular expressions
       carefully, since normal quoting and pattern characters lose their mean‐
       ings between brackets. (press h for help or q to quit)
 ESESCOBpage bash(1) line 396 (press h for help or q to quit)
       The  pattern  will  match if it matches any part of the string.  Anchor
       the pattern using the ^ and $ regular expression operators to force  it
       to  match  the  entire string.  The array variable BASH_REMATCH records
       which parts of the string matched the pattern.  The element of BASH_RE‐
       MATCH  with index 0 contains the portion of the string matching the en‐
       tire regular expression.  Substrings matched  by  parenthesized  subex‐
       pressions  within  the  regular  expression  are saved in the remaining
       BASH_REMATCH indices. The element of BASH_REMATCH with index n  is  the
       portion  of  the  string  matching the nth parenthesized subexpression.
       Bash sets BASH_REMATCH in the global scope; declaring  it  as  a  local
       variable will lead to unexpected results.or q to quit)

              The list of words following in is expanded, generating a list of
              items.  The variable name is set to each element of this list in
              turn,  and  list is executed each time.  If the in word is omit‐
              ted, the for command executes list once for each positional  pa‐
              rameter  that  is set (see PARAMETERS below).  The return status
              is the exit status of the last command that  executes.   If  the
              expansion of the items following in results in an empty list, no

              First, the arithmetic expression expr1 is evaluated according to
              the  rules  described  below  under  ARITHMETIC EVALUATION.  The
              arithmetic expression expr2 is then evaluated  repeatedly  until
              it  evaluates  to zero.  Each time expr2 evaluates to a non-zero
              value, list is executed and the arithmetic expression  expr3  is
              evaluated.   If  any  expression is omitted, it behaves as if it
              evaluates to 1.  The return value is the exit status of the last
              command in list that is executed, or false if any of the expres‐

              The list of words following in is expanded, generating a list of
              items,  and the set of expanded words is printed on the standard
              error, each preceded by a number.  If the in  word  is  omitted,
              the  positional  parameters  are printed (see PARAMETERS below).
              select then displays the PS3 prompt and reads a  line  from  the
              standard  input.  If the line consists of a number corresponding
              to one of the displayed words, then the value of name is set  to
              that  word.  If the line is empty, the words and prompt are dis‐
              played again.  If EOF is read, the select command completes  and
              returns  1.  Any other value read causes name to be set to null.
              The line read is saved in the variable REPLY.  The list is  exe‐
              cuted  after  each  selection until a break command is executed.
              The exit status of select is the exit status of the last command
              executed in list, or zero if no commands were executed.

       case word in [ [(] pattern [ | pattern ] ... ) list ;; ] ... esac
              A case command first expands word, and tries to match it against
              each pattern in turn, using the matching rules  described  under
              Pattern Matching below.  The word is expanded using tilde expan‐
              sion, parameter and variable  expansion,  arithmetic  expansion,
              command  substitution,  process  substitution and quote removal.
              Each pattern examined is expanded using tilde expansion, parame‐
              ter  and  variable expansion, arithmetic expansion, command sub‐
              stitution, process substitution, and quote removal.  If the  no‐
              casematch  shell option is enabled, the match is performed with‐
              out regard to the case of alphabetic characters.  When  a  match
              is  found, the corresponding list is executed.  If the ;; opera‐
              tor is used, no subsequent matches are attempted after the first
              pattern match.  Using ;& in place of ;; causes execution to con‐

              list on a successful match, continuing the case statement execu‐
              tion as if the pattern list had not matched.  The exit status is

   Parameter Expansion
       The `$' character introduces parameter expansion, command sub‐
       stitution,  or  arithmetic  expansion.   The parameter name or
       symbol to be expanded may be enclosed in braces, which are op‐
       tional  but  serve to protect the variable to be expanded from
       characters immediately following it which could be interpreted
       as part of the name.

       When  braces  are used, the matching ending brace is the first
       `}' not escaped by a backslash or within a quoted string,  and
       not within an embedded arithmetic expansion, command substitu‐
       tion, or parameter expansion.

 Manual page bash(1) line 1902 (press h for help or q to quit)   Parameter Expansion
       The `$' character introduces parameter expansion, command sub‐
       stitution,  or  arithmetic  expansion.   The parameter name or
       symbol to be expanded may be enclosed in braces, which are op‐
       tional  but  serve to protect the variable to be expanded from
       characters immediately following it which could be interpreted
       as part of the name.

       When  braces  are used, the matching ending brace is the first
       `}' not escaped by a backslash or within a quoted string,  and
       not within an embedded arithmetic expansion, command substitu‐
       tion, or parameter expansion.

       ${parameter}
              The value of parameter is substituted.  The braces  are
              required  when parameter is a positional parameter with
              more than one digit, or when parameter is followed by a
              character which is not to be interpreted as part of its
              name.  The parameter is a shell parameter as  described
              above PARAMETERS) or an array reference (Arrays).
 ESESCOBpage bash(1) line 1908 (press h for help or q to quit)
       If  the  first  character of parameter is an exclamation point
       (!), and parameter is not a nameref, it introduces a level  of
       indirection.  Bash uses the value formed by expanding the rest
       of parameter as the new parameter; this is then  expanded  and
       that  value  is used in the rest of the expansion, rather than
       the expansion of the original parameter.  This is known as in‐
       direct  expansion.   The  value is subject to tilde expansion,

       that  value  is used in the rest of the expansion, rather than
       the expansion of the original parameter.  This is known as in‐
       direct  expansion.   The  value is subject to tilde expansion,
       parameter expansion, command substitution, and arithmetic  ex‐
       pansion.   If parameter is a nameref, this expands to the name
       of the parameter referenced by parameter instead of performing
       the  complete  indirect expansion.  The exceptions to this are
       the expansions of ${!prefix*} and ${!name[@]} described below.
       The  exclamation  point must immediately follow the left brace
       in order to introduce indirection.or help or q to quit)

       When not performing substring expansion, using the forms docu‐
       mented  below  (e.g.,  :-), bash tests for a parameter that is
       unset or null.  Omitting the colon results in a test only  for
       a parameter that is unset.ress h for help or q to quit)

              Assign  Default Values.  If parameter is unset or null,
              the expansion of word is assigned  to  parameter.   The
              value of parameter is then substituted.  Positional pa‐
              rameters and special parameters may not be assigned  to
              in this way.1942 (press h for help or q to quit)

              or unset, the expansion of word (or a message  to  that
              effect  if word is not present) is written to the stan‐
              dard error and the shell, if it is not interactive, ex‐
              its.  Otherwise, the value of parameter is substituted.
       ${parameter:+word} 1949 (press h for help or q to quit)
              Use  Alternate  Value.   If parameter is null or unset,
              nothing is substituted, otherwise the expansion of word
              is substituted.2 (press h for help or q to quit)
