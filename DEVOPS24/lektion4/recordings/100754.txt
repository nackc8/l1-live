[m
[1mDESCRIPTION[0m[m
       Create a new commit containing the current contents of the index and the given log message[m
       describing the changes. The new commit is a direct child of HEAD, usually the tip of the[m
       current branch, and the branch is updated to point to it (unless no branch is associated with[m
       the working tree, in which case HEAD is "detached" as described in [1mgit-checkout[0m(1)).[m
[m
       The content to be committed can be specified in several ways:[m
[m
        1. by using [1mgit-add[0m(1) to incrementally "add" changes to the index before using the [4mcommit[24m[m
[7m Manual page git-commit(1) line 1 (press h for help or q to quit)[27m[K[K           command (Note: even modified files must be "added");[m
[m
        2. by using [1mgit-rm[0m(1) to remove files from the working tree and the index, again before[m
           using the [4mcommit[24m command;[m
[m
        3. by listing files as arguments to the [4mcommit[24m command (without --interactive or --patch[m
           switch), in which case the commit will ignore changes staged in the index, and instead[m
           record the current content of the listed files (which must already be known to Git);[m
[m
        4. by using the -a switch with the [4mcommit[24m command to automatically "add" changes from all[m
           known files (i.e. all files that are already listed in the index) and to automatically[m
           "rm" files in the index that have been removed from the working tree, and then perform[m
           the actual commit;[m
[m
        5. by using the --interactive or --patch switches with the [4mcommit[24m command to decide one by[m
           one which files or hunks should be part of the commit in addition to contents in the[m
           index, before finalizing the operation. See the ‚ÄúInteractive Mode‚Äù section of [1mgit-add[0m(1)[m
           to learn how to operate these modes.[m
[m
       The [1m--dry-run[0m option can be used to obtain a summary of what is included by any of the above[m
       for the next commit by giving the same set of parameters (options and paths).[m
[m
       If you make a commit and then find a mistake immediately after that, you can recover from it[m
       with [4mgit[24m [4mreset[24m.[m
[7m Manual page git-commit(1) line 25 (press h for help or q to quit)[27m[K[K[m
[1mOPTIONS[0m[m
       -a, --all[m
           Tell the command to automatically stage files that have been modified and deleted, but[m
           new files you have not told Git about are not affected.[m
[m
       -p, --patch[m
           Use the interactive patch selection interface to choose which changes to commit. See [1mgit-[0m[m
           [1madd[0m(1) for details.[m
[m
       -C <commit>, --reuse-message=<commit>[m
           Take an existing commit object, and reuse the log message and the authorship information[m
           (including the timestamp) when creating the commit.[m
[m
       -c <commit>, --reedit-message=<commit>[m
           Like [4m-C[24m, but with [1m-c[0m the editor is invoked, so that the user can further edit the commit[m
           message.[m
[m
       --fixup=[(amend|reword):]<commit>[m
           Create a new commit which "fixes up" [1m<commit>[0m when applied with [1mgit[0m [1mrebase[0m [1m--autosquash[0m.[m
           Plain [1m--fixup=<commit>[0m creates a "fixup!" commit which changes the content of [1m<commit>[0m[m
           but leaves its log message untouched.  [1m--fixup=amend:<commit>[0m is similar but creates an[m
           "amend!" commit which also replaces the log message of [1m<commit>[0m with the log message of[m
           the "amend!" commit.  [1m--fixup=reword:<commit>[0m creates an "amend!" commit which replaces[m
[7m Manual page git-commit(1) line 49 (press h for help or q to quit)[27m[K[K           the log message of [1m<commit>[0m with its own log message but makes no changes to the content[m
           of [1m<commit>[0m.[m
[m
           The commit created by plain [1m--fixup=<commit>[0m has a subject composed of "fixup!" followed[m
           by the subject line from <commit>, and is recognized specially by [1mgit[0m [1mrebase[0m[m
           [1m--autosquash[0m. The [1m-m[0m option may be used to supplement the log message of the created[m
           commit, but the additional commentary will be thrown away once the "fixup!" commit is[m
           squashed into [1m<commit>[0m by [1mgit[0m [1mrebase[0m [1m--autosquash[0m.[m
[m
           The commit created by [1m--fixup=amend:<commit>[0m is similar but its subject is instead[m
           prefixed with "amend!". The log message of <commit> is copied into the log message of the[m
           "amend!" commit and opened in an editor so it can be refined. When [1mgit[0m [1mrebase[0m[m
           [1m--autosquash[0m squashes the "amend!" commit into [1m<commit>[0m, the log message of [1m<commit>[0m is[m
           replaced by the refined log message from the "amend!" commit. It is an error for the[m
           "amend!" commit‚Äôs log message to be empty unless [1m--allow-empty-message[0m is specified.[m
[m
           [1m--fixup=reword:<commit>[0m is shorthand for [1m--fixup=amend:<commit>[0m [1m--only[0m. It creates an[m
           "amend!" commit with only a log message (ignoring any changes staged in the index). When[m
           squashed by [1mgit[0m [1mrebase[0m [1m--autosquash[0m, it replaces the log message of [1m<commit>[0m without[m
           making any other changes.[m
[m
           Neither "fixup!" nor "amend!" commits change authorship of [1m<commit>[0m when applied by [1mgit[0m[m
           [1mrebase[0m [1m--autosquash[0m. See [1mgit-rebase[0m(1) for details.[m
[m
[7m Manual page git-commit(1) line 73 (press h for help or q to quit)[27m[K[K       --squash=<commit>[m
           Construct a commit message for use with [1mrebase[0m [1m--autosquash[0m. The commit message subject[m
           line is taken from the specified commit with a prefix of "squash! ". Can be used with[m
           additional commit message options ([1m-m[0m/[1m-c[0m/[1m-C[0m/[1m-F[0m). See [1mgit-rebase[0m(1) for details.[m
[m
       --reset-author[m
           When used with -C/-c/--amend options, or when committing after a conflicting cherry-pick,[m
           declare that the authorship of the resulting commit now belongs to the committer. This[m
           also renews the author timestamp.[m
[m
       --short[m
           When doing a dry-run, give the output in the short-format. See [1mgit-status[0m(1) for details.[m
           Implies [1m--dry-run[0m.[m

       --branch[m
           Show the branch and tracking info even in short-format.[m
[m
       --porcelain[m
           When doing a dry-run, give the output in a porcelain-ready format. See [1mgit-status[0m(1) for[m
           details. Implies [1m--dry-run[0m.[m
[m
       --long[m
           When doing a dry-run, give the output in the long-format. Implies [1m--dry-run[0m.[m
[m
[7m Manual page git-commit(1) line 97 (press h for help or q to quit)[27m[K[K       -z, --null[m
           When showing [1mshort[0m or [1mporcelain[0m status output, print the filename verbatim and terminate[m
           the entries with NUL, instead of LF. If no format is given, implies the [1m--porcelain[0m[m
           output format. Without the [1m-z[0m option, filenames with "unusual" characters are quoted as[m
           explained for the configuration variable [1mcore.quotePath[0m (see [1mgit-config[0m(1)).[m
[m
       -F <file>, --file=<file>[m
           Take the commit message from the given file. Use [4m-[24m to read the message from the standard[m
           input.[m
[m
       --author=<author>[m
           Override the commit author. Specify an explicit author using the standard [1mA[0m [1mU[0m [1mThor[0m[m
           [1m<author@example.com>[0m format. Otherwise <author> is assumed to be a pattern and is used to[m
           search for an existing commit by that author (i.e. rev-list --all -i --author=<author>);[m
           the commit author is then copied from the first such commit found.[m
[m
       --date=<date>[m
           Override the author date used in the commit.[m
[m
       -m <msg>, --message=<msg>[m
           Use the given <msg> as the commit message. If multiple [1m-m[0m options are given, their values[m
           are concatenated as separate paragraphs.[m
[m
           The [1m-m[0m option is mutually exclusive with [1m-c[0m, [1m-C[0m, and [1m-F[0m.[m
[7m Manual page git-commit(1) line 121 (press h for help or q to quit)[27m[K[K[m
       -t <file>, --template=<file>[m
           When editing the commit message, start the editor with the contents in the given file.[m
           The [1mcommit.template[0m configuration variable is often used to give this option implicitly[m
           to the command. This mechanism can be used by projects that want to guide participants[m
           with some hints on what to write in the message in what order. If the user exits the[m
           editor without editing the message, the commit is aborted. This has no effect when a[m
           message is given by other means, e.g. with the [1m-m[0m or [1m-F[0m options.[m
[m
       -s, --signoff, --no-signoff[m
           Add a [1mSigned-off-by[0m trailer by the committer at the end of the commit log message. The[m
           meaning of a signoff depends on the project to which you‚Äôre committing. For example, it[m
           may certify that the committer has the rights to submit the work under the project‚Äôs[m
           license or agrees to some contributor representation, such as a Developer Certificate of[m
           Origin. (See [1mhttp://developercertificate.org[0m for the one used by the Linux kernel and Git[m
           projects.) Consult the documentation or leadership of the project to which you‚Äôre[m
           contributing to understand how the signoffs are used in that project.[m
[m
           The --no-signoff option can be used to countermand an earlier --signoff option on the[m
           command line.[m
[m
       --trailer <token>[(=|:)<value>][m
           Specify a (<token>, <value>) pair that should be applied as a trailer. (e.g.  [1mgit[0m [1mcommit[0m[m
           [1m--trailer[0m [1m"Signed-off-by:C[0m [1mO[0m [1mMitter[0m [1m\[0m [1m<committer@example.com>"[0m [1m--trailer[0m [1m"Helped-by:C[0m [1mO[0m[m

           "Helped-by" trailer to the commit message.) The [1mtrailer.*[0m  configuration variables ([1mgit-[0m[m
           [1minterpret-trailers[0m(1)) can be used to define if a duplicated trailer is omitted, where in[m
           the run of trailers each trailer would appear, and other details.[m
[m
       -n, --[no-]verify[m
           By default, the pre-commit and commit-msg hooks are run. When any of [1m--no-verify[0m or [1m-n[0m is[m
           given, these are bypassed. See also [1mgithooks[0m(5).[m
[m
       --allow-empty[m
           Usually recording a commit that has the exact same tree as its sole parent commit is a[m
           mistake, and the command prevents you from making such a commit. This option bypasses the[m
           safety, and is primarily for use by foreign SCM interface scripts.[m
[m
       --allow-empty-message[m
           Like --allow-empty this command is primarily for use by foreign SCM interface scripts. It[m
           allows you to create a commit with an empty commit message without using plumbing[m
           commands like [1mgit-commit-tree[0m(1).[m
[m
       --cleanup=<mode>[m
           This option determines how the supplied commit message should be cleaned up before[m
           committing. The [4m<mode>[24m can be [1mstrip[0m, [1mwhitespace[0m, [1mverbatim[0m, [1mscissors[0m or [1mdefault[0m.[m

           these files are also staged for the next commit on top of what have been staged before.[m

[m
[1mEXAMPLES[0m[m
       When recording your own work, the contents of modified files in your working tree are[m
       temporarily stored to a staging area called the "index" with [4mgit[24m [4madd[24m. A file can be reverted[m
       back, only in the index but not in the working tree, to that of the last commit with [1mgit[0m[m
       [1mrestore[0m [1m--staged[0m [1m<file>[0m, which effectively reverts [4mgit[24m [4madd[24m and prevents the changes to this[m
       file from participating in the next commit. After building the state to be committed[m
       incrementally with these commands, [1mgit[0m [1mcommit[0m (without any pathname parameter) is used to[m
[7m Manual page git-commit(1) line 313 (press h for help or q to quit)[27m[K[K       record what has been staged so far. This is the most basic form of the command. An example:[m
[m
           $ edit hello.c[m
           $ git rm goodbye.c[m
           $ git add hello.c[m
           $ git commit[m
[m
       Instead of staging files after each individual change, you can tell [1mgit[0m [1mcommit[0m to notice the[m
       changes to the files whose contents are tracked in your working tree and do corresponding [1mgit[0m[m
       [1madd[0m and [1mgit[0m [1mrm[0m for you. That is, this example does the same as the earlier example if there[m
       is no other change in your working tree:[m
[m
           $ edit hello.c[m
           $ rm goodbye.c[m
           $ git commit -a[m
[m
       The command [1mgit[0m [1mcommit[0m [1m-a[0m first looks at your working tree, notices that you have modified[m
       hello.c and removed goodbye.c, and performs necessary [1mgit[0m [1madd[0m and [1mgit[0m [1mrm[0m for you.[m
[m
       After staging changes to many files, you can alter the order the changes are recorded in, by[m
       giving pathnames to [1mgit[0m [1mcommit[0m. When pathnames are given, the command makes a commit that[m
       only records the changes made to the named paths:[m
[m
           $ edit hello.c hello.h[m
[7m Manual page git-commit(1) line 337 (press h for help or q to quit)[27m[K[K           $ git add hello.c hello.h[m
           $ edit Makefile[m
           $ git commit Makefile[m
[m
       This makes a commit that records the modification to [1mMakefile[0m. The changes staged for [1mhello.c[0m[m
       and [1mhello.h[0m are not included in the resulting commit. However, their changes are not lost ‚Äî[m
       they are still staged and merely held back. After the above sequence, if you do:[m
[m
           $ git commit[m
[m
       this second commit would record the changes to [1mhello.c[0m and [1mhello.h[0m as expected.[m
[m
       After a merge (initiated by [4mgit[24m [4mmerge[24m or [4mgit[24m [4mpull[24m) stops because of conflicts, cleanly merged[m
       paths are already staged to be committed for you, and paths that conflicted are left in[m
       unmerged state. You would have to first check which paths are conflicting with [4mgit[24m [4mstatus[24m and[m
       after fixing them manually in your working tree, you would stage the result as usual with [4mgit[24m[m
       [4madd[24m:[m
[m
           $ git status | grep unmerged[m
           unmerged: hello.c[m
           $ edit hello.c[m
           $ git add hello.c[m
[m
       After resolving conflicts and staging the result, [1mgit[0m [1mls-files[0m [1m-u[0m would stop mentioning the[m
[7m Manual page git-commit(1) line 361 (press h for help or q to quit)[27m[K[K       conflicted path. When you are done, run [1mgit[0m [1mcommit[0m to finally record the merge:[m
[m
           $ git commit[m
[m
       As with the case to record your own changes, you can use [1m-a[0m option to save typing. One[m
       difference is that during a merge resolution, you cannot use [1mgit[0m [1mcommit[0m with pathnames to[m
       alter the order the changes are committed, because the merge should be recorded as a single[m
       commit. In fact, the command refuses to run when given pathnames (but see [1m-i[0m option).[m
[m
[1mCOMMIT[0m [1mINFORMATION[0m[m
       Author and committer information is taken from the following environment variables, if set:[m

[m
       The author and committer names are by convention some form of a personal name (that is, the[m
       name by which other humans refer to you), although Git does not enforce or require any[m
       particular form. Arbitrary Unicode may be used, subject to the constraints listed above. This[m

       configuration items [1muser.name[0m and [1muser.email[0m, or, if not present, the environment variable[m
       EMAIL, or, if that is not set, system user name and the hostname used for outgoing mail[m
       (taken from [1m/etc/mailname[0m and falling back to the fully qualified hostname when that file[m
       does not exist).[m
[m
       The [1mauthor.name[0m and [1mcommitter.name[0m and their corresponding email options override [1muser.name[0m[m
       and [1muser.email[0m if set and are overridden themselves by the environment variables.[m
[m
       The typical usage is to set just the [1muser.name[0m and [1muser.email[0m variables; the other options[m
       are provided for more complex use cases.[m

[1mDISCUSSION[0m[m
       Though not required, it‚Äôs a good idea to begin the commit message with a single short (less[m
       than 50 character) line summarizing the change, followed by a blank line and then a more[m
       thorough description. The text up to the first blank line in a commit message is treated as[m
       the commit title, and that title is used throughout Git. For example, [1mgit-format-patch[0m(1)[m
       turns a commit into email, and it uses the title on the Subject line and the rest of the[m
[7m Manual page git-commit(1) line 433 (press h for help or q to quit)[27m[K[K       commit in the body.[m
[m
       Git is to some extent character encoding agnostic.[m
[m
       ‚Ä¢   The contents of the blob objects are uninterpreted sequences of bytes. There is no[m
           encoding translation at the core level.[m
[m
       ‚Ä¢   Path names are encoded in UTF-8 normalization form C. This applies to tree objects, the[m
           index file, ref names, as well as path names in command line arguments, environment[m
           variables and config files ([1m.git/config[0m (see [1mgit-config[0m(1)), [1mgitignore[0m(5),[m
           [1mgitattributes[0m(5) and [1mgitmodules[0m(5)).[m
[m
           Note that Git at the core level treats path names simply as sequences of non-NUL bytes,[m
           there are no path name encoding conversions (except on Mac and Windows). Therefore, using[m
           non-ASCII path names will mostly work even on platforms and file systems that use legacy[m
           extended ASCII encodings. However, repositories created on such systems will not work[m
           properly on UTF-8-based systems (e.g. Linux, Mac, Windows) and vice versa. Additionally,[m
           many Git-based tools simply assume path names to be UTF-8 and will fail to display other[m
           encodings correctly.[m
[m
       ‚Ä¢   Commit log messages are typically encoded in UTF-8, but other extended ASCII encodings[m
           are also supported. This includes ISO-8859-x, CP125x and many others, but [4mnot[24m UTF-16/32,[m
           EBCDIC and CJK multi-byte encodings (GBK, Shift-JIS, Big5, EUC-x, CP9xx etc.).[m

[7m Manual page git-commit(1) line 457 (press h for help or q to quit)[27m[K[K       Although we encourage that the commit log messages are encoded in UTF-8, both the core and[m
       Git Porcelain are designed not to force UTF-8 on projects. If all participants of a[m
       particular project find it more convenient to use legacy encodings, Git does not forbid it.[m
       However, there are a few things to keep in mind.[m
[m
        1. [4mgit[24m [4mcommit[24m and [4mgit[24m [4mcommit-tree[24m issues a warning if the commit log message given to it[m
           does not look like a valid UTF-8 string, unless you explicitly say your project uses a[m
           legacy encoding. The way to say this is to have [1mi18n.commitEncoding[0m in [1m.git/config[0m file,[m
           like this:[m
[m

                       commitEncoding = ISO-8859-1[m

           its [1mencoding[0m header. This is to help other people who look at them later. Lack of this[m
           header implies that the commit log message is encoded in UTF-8.[m

[m
       Note that we deliberately chose not to re-code the commit log message when a commit is made[m
       to force UTF-8 at the commit object level, because re-coding to UTF-8 is not necessarily a[m
       reversible operation.[m

           This setting overrides the default of the [1m--cleanup[0m option in [1mgit[0m [1mcommit[0m. See [1mgit-[0m[m
           [1mcommit[0m(1) for details. Changing the default can be useful when you always want to keep[m
           lines that begin with comment character [1m#[0m in your log message, in which case you would do[m

[m
       commit.gpgSign[m
           A boolean to specify whether all commits should be GPG signed. Use of this option when[m
[7m Manual page git-commit(1) line 505 (press h for help or q to quit)[27m[K[K           doing operations such as rebase can result in a large number of commits being signed. It[m
           may be convenient to use an agent to avoid typing your GPG passphrase several times.[m
[m
       commit.status[m
           A boolean to enable/disable inclusion of status information in the commit message[m
