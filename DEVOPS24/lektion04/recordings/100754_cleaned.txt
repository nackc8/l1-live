NAME
       git-commit - Record changes to the repository

SYNOPSIS
       git commit [-a | --interactive | --patch] [-s] [-v] [-u<mode>] [--amend]
                  [--dry-run] [(-c | -C | --squash) <commit> | --fixup [(amend|reword):]<commit>)]

                  [--] [<pathspec>...]

DESCRIPTION
       Create a new commit containing the current contents of the index and the given log message
       describing the changes. The new commit is a direct child of HEAD, usually the tip of the
       current branch, and the branch is updated to point to it (unless no branch is associated with
       the working tree, in which case HEAD is "detached" as described in git-checkout(1)).

       The content to be committed can be specified in several ways:

        1. by using git-add(1) to incrementally "add" changes to the index before using the commit
           command (Note: even modified files must be "added");t)

        2. by using git-rm(1) to remove files from the working tree and the index, again before
           using the commit command;

        3. by listing files as arguments to the commit command (without --interactive or --patch
           switch), in which case the commit will ignore changes staged in the index, and instead
           record the current content of the listed files (which must already be known to Git);

        4. by using the -a switch with the commit command to automatically "add" changes from all
           known files (i.e. all files that are already listed in the index) and to automatically
           "rm" files in the index that have been removed from the working tree, and then perform
           the actual commit;

        5. by using the --interactive or --patch switches with the commit command to decide one by
           one which files or hunks should be part of the commit in addition to contents in the
           index, before finalizing the operation. See the “Interactive Mode” section of git-add(1)
           to learn how to operate these modes.

       The --dry-run option can be used to obtain a summary of what is included by any of the above
       for the next commit by giving the same set of parameters (options and paths).

       If you make a commit and then find a mistake immediately after that, you can recover from it
       with git reset.
 Manual page git-commit(1) line 25 (press h for help or q to quit)
OPTIONS
       -a, --all
           Tell the command to automatically stage files that have been modified and deleted, but
           new files you have not told Git about are not affected.

       -p, --patch
           Use the interactive patch selection interface to choose which changes to commit. See git-
           add(1) for details.

       -C <commit>, --reuse-message=<commit>
           Take an existing commit object, and reuse the log message and the authorship information
           (including the timestamp) when creating the commit.

       -c <commit>, --reedit-message=<commit>
           Like -C, but with -c the editor is invoked, so that the user can further edit the commit
           message.

       --fixup=[(amend|reword):]<commit>
           Create a new commit which "fixes up" <commit> when applied with git rebase --autosquash.
           Plain --fixup=<commit> creates a "fixup!" commit which changes the content of <commit>
           but leaves its log message untouched.  --fixup=amend:<commit> is similar but creates an
           "amend!" commit which also replaces the log message of <commit> with the log message of
           the "amend!" commit.  --fixup=reword:<commit> creates an "amend!" commit which replaces
           the log message of <commit> with its own log message but makes no changes to the content
           of <commit>.

           The commit created by plain --fixup=<commit> has a subject composed of "fixup!" followed
           by the subject line from <commit>, and is recognized specially by git rebase
           --autosquash. The -m option may be used to supplement the log message of the created
           commit, but the additional commentary will be thrown away once the "fixup!" commit is
           squashed into <commit> by git rebase --autosquash.

           The commit created by --fixup=amend:<commit> is similar but its subject is instead
           prefixed with "amend!". The log message of <commit> is copied into the log message of the
           "amend!" commit and opened in an editor so it can be refined. When git rebase
           --autosquash squashes the "amend!" commit into <commit>, the log message of <commit> is
           replaced by the refined log message from the "amend!" commit. It is an error for the
           "amend!" commit’s log message to be empty unless --allow-empty-message is specified.

           --fixup=reword:<commit> is shorthand for --fixup=amend:<commit> --only. It creates an
           "amend!" commit with only a log message (ignoring any changes staged in the index). When
           squashed by git rebase --autosquash, it replaces the log message of <commit> without
           making any other changes.

           Neither "fixup!" nor "amend!" commits change authorship of <commit> when applied by git
           rebase --autosquash. See git-rebase(1) for details.

       --squash=<commit>1) line 73 (press h for help or q to quit)
           Construct a commit message for use with rebase --autosquash. The commit message subject
           line is taken from the specified commit with a prefix of "squash! ". Can be used with
           additional commit message options (-m/-c/-C/-F). See git-rebase(1) for details.

       --reset-author
           When used with -C/-c/--amend options, or when committing after a conflicting cherry-pick,
           declare that the authorship of the resulting commit now belongs to the committer. This
           also renews the author timestamp.

       --short
           When doing a dry-run, give the output in the short-format. See git-status(1) for details.
           Implies --dry-run.

       --branch
           Show the branch and tracking info even in short-format.

       --porcelain
           When doing a dry-run, give the output in a porcelain-ready format. See git-status(1) for
           details. Implies --dry-run.

       --long
           When doing a dry-run, give the output in the long-format. Implies --dry-run.

       -z, --nullcommit(1) line 97 (press h for help or q to quit)
           When showing short or porcelain status output, print the filename verbatim and terminate
           the entries with NUL, instead of LF. If no format is given, implies the --porcelain
           output format. Without the -z option, filenames with "unusual" characters are quoted as
           explained for the configuration variable core.quotePath (see git-config(1)).

       -F <file>, --file=<file>
           Take the commit message from the given file. Use - to read the message from the standard
           input.

       --author=<author>
           Override the commit author. Specify an explicit author using the standard A U Thor
           <author@example.com> format. Otherwise <author> is assumed to be a pattern and is used to
           search for an existing commit by that author (i.e. rev-list --all -i --author=<author>);
           the commit author is then copied from the first such commit found.

       --date=<date>
           Override the author date used in the commit.

       -m <msg>, --message=<msg>
           Use the given <msg> as the commit message. If multiple -m options are given, their values
           are concatenated as separate paragraphs.

           The -m option is mutually exclusive with -c, -C, and -F.
 Manual page git-commit(1) line 121 (press h for help or q to quit)
       -t <file>, --template=<file>
           When editing the commit message, start the editor with the contents in the given file.
           The commit.template configuration variable is often used to give this option implicitly
           to the command. This mechanism can be used by projects that want to guide participants
           with some hints on what to write in the message in what order. If the user exits the
           editor without editing the message, the commit is aborted. This has no effect when a
           message is given by other means, e.g. with the -m or -F options.

       -s, --signoff, --no-signoff
           Add a Signed-off-by trailer by the committer at the end of the commit log message. The
           meaning of a signoff depends on the project to which you’re committing. For example, it
           may certify that the committer has the rights to submit the work under the project’s
           license or agrees to some contributor representation, such as a Developer Certificate of
           Origin. (See http://developercertificate.org for the one used by the Linux kernel and Git
           projects.) Consult the documentation or leadership of the project to which you’re
           contributing to understand how the signoffs are used in that project.

           The --no-signoff option can be used to countermand an earlier --signoff option on the
           command line.

       --trailer <token>[(=|:)<value>]
           Specify a (<token>, <value>) pair that should be applied as a trailer. (e.g.  git commit
           --trailer "Signed-off-by:C O Mitter \ <committer@example.com>" --trailer "Helped-by:C O
           Mitter \ <committer@example.com>" will add the "Signed-off-by" trailer and the
           "Helped-by" trailer to the commit message.) The trailer.*  configuration variables (git-
           interpret-trailers(1)) can be used to define if a duplicated trailer is omitted, where in
           the run of trailers each trailer would appear, and other details.

       -n, --[no-]verify
           By default, the pre-commit and commit-msg hooks are run. When any of --no-verify or -n is
           given, these are bypassed. See also githooks(5).

       --allow-empty
           Usually recording a commit that has the exact same tree as its sole parent commit is a
           mistake, and the command prevents you from making such a commit. This option bypasses the
           safety, and is primarily for use by foreign SCM interface scripts.

       --allow-empty-message
           Like --allow-empty this command is primarily for use by foreign SCM interface scripts. It
           allows you to create a commit with an empty commit message without using plumbing
           commands like git-commit-tree(1).

       --cleanup=<mode>
           This option determines how the supplied commit message should be cleaned up before
           committing. The <mode> can be strip, whitespace, verbatim, scissors or default.

           strip
               Strip leading and trailing empty lines, trailing whitespace, commentary and collapse
               consecutive empty lines.

           whitespace
               Same as strip except #commentary is not removed.

           verbatim
               Do not change the message at all.

           scissors
               Same as whitespace except that everything from (and including) the line found below
               is truncated, if the message is to be edited. "#" can be customized with
               core.commentChar.

                   # ------------------------ >8 ------------------------

           default
               Same as strip if the message is to be edited. Otherwise whitespace.

           The default can be changed by the commit.cleanup configuration variable (see git-
           config(1)).

       -e, --edit
           The message taken from file with -F, command line with -m, and from commit object with -C
           are usually used as the commit log message unmodified. This option lets you further edit
           the message taken from these sources.

       --no-edit
           Use the selected commit message without launching an editor. For example, git commit
           --amend --no-edit amends a commit without changing its commit message.

       --amend
           Replace the tip of the current branch by creating a new commit. The recorded tree is
           prepared as usual (including the effect of the -i and -o options and explicit pathspec),
           and the message from the original commit is used as the starting point, instead of an
           empty message, when no other message is specified from the command line via options such
           as -m, -F, -c, etc. The new commit has the same parents and author as the current one
           (the --reset-author option can countermand this).

           It is a rough equivalent for:

                       $ git reset --soft HEAD^
                       $ ... do something else to come up with the right tree ...
                       $ git commit -c ORIG_HEAD

           but can be used to amend a merge commit.

           You should understand the implications of rewriting history if you amend a commit that
           has already been published. (See the "RECOVERING FROM UPSTREAM REBASE" section in git-
           rebase(1).)

       --no-post-rewrite
           Bypass the post-rewrite hook.

       -i, --include
           Before making a commit out of staged contents so far, stage the contents of paths given
           on the command line as well. This is usually not what you want unless you are concluding
           a conflicted merge.

       -o, --only
           Make a commit by taking the updated working tree contents of the paths specified on the
           command line, disregarding any contents that have been staged for other paths. This is
           the default mode of operation of git commit if any paths are given on the command line,
           in which case this option can be omitted. If this option is specified together with
           --amend, then no paths need to be specified, which can be used to amend the last commit
           without committing changes that have already been staged. If used together with
           --allow-empty paths are also not required, and an empty commit will be created.

       --pathspec-from-file=<file>
           Pathspec is passed in <file> instead of commandline args. If <file> is exactly - then
           standard input is used. Pathspec elements are separated by LF or CR/LF. Pathspec elements
           can be quoted as explained for the configuration variable core.quotePath (see git-
           config(1)). See also --pathspec-file-nul and global --literal-pathspecs.

       --pathspec-file-nul
           Only meaningful with --pathspec-from-file. Pathspec elements are separated with NUL
           character and all other characters are taken literally (including newlines and quotes).

       -u[<mode>], --untracked-files[=<mode>]
           Show untracked files.

           The mode parameter is optional (defaults to all), and is used to specify the handling of
           untracked files; when -u is not used, the default is normal, i.e. show untracked files
           and directories.

           The possible options are:

           •   no - Show no untracked files

           •   normal - Shows untracked files and directories

           •   all - Also shows individual files in untracked directories.

           The default can be changed using the status.showUntrackedFiles configuration variable
           documented in git-config(1).

       -v, --verbosemit(1) line 265 (press h for help or q to quit)
           Show unified diff between the HEAD commit and what would be committed at the bottom of
           the commit message template to help the user describe the commit by reminding what
           changes the commit has. Note that this diff output doesn’t have its lines prefixed with
           #. This diff will not be a part of the commit message. See the commit.verbose
           configuration variable in git-config(1).

           If specified twice, show in addition the unified diff between what would be committed and
           the worktree files, i.e. the unstaged changes to tracked files.

       -q, --quiet
           Suppress commit summary message.

       --dry-run
           Do not create a commit, but show a list of paths that are to be committed, paths with
           local changes that will be left uncommitted and paths that are untracked.

       --status
           Include the output of git-status(1) in the commit message template when using an editor
           to prepare the commit message. Defaults to on, but can be used to override configuration
           variable commit.status.

       --no-status
           Do not include the output of git-status(1) in the commit message template when using an
           editor to prepare the default commit message. q to quit)

       -S[<keyid>], --gpg-sign[=<keyid>], --no-gpg-sign
           GPG-sign commits. The keyid argument is optional and defaults to the committer identity;
           if specified, it must be stuck to the option without a space.  --no-gpg-sign is useful to
           countermand both commit.gpgSign configuration variable, and earlier --gpg-sign.

       --
           Do not interpret any more arguments as options.

       <pathspec>...
           When pathspec is given on the command line, commit the contents of the files that match
           the pathspec without recording the changes already added to the index. The contents of
           these files are also staged for the next commit on top of what have been staged before.

           For more details, see the pathspec entry in gitglossary(7).

EXAMPLES
       When recording your own work, the contents of modified files in your working tree are
       temporarily stored to a staging area called the "index" with git add. A file can be reverted
       back, only in the index but not in the working tree, to that of the last commit with git
       restore --staged <file>, which effectively reverts git add and prevents the changes to this
       file from participating in the next commit. After building the state to be committed
       incrementally with these commands, git commit (without any pathname parameter) is used to
       record what has been staged so far. This is the most basic form of the command. An example:

           $ edit hello.c
           $ git rm goodbye.c
           $ git add hello.c
           $ git commit

       Instead of staging files after each individual change, you can tell git commit to notice the
       changes to the files whose contents are tracked in your working tree and do corresponding git
       add and git rm for you. That is, this example does the same as the earlier example if there
       is no other change in your working tree:

           $ edit hello.c
           $ rm goodbye.c
           $ git commit -a

       The command git commit -a first looks at your working tree, notices that you have modified
       hello.c and removed goodbye.c, and performs necessary git add and git rm for you.

       After staging changes to many files, you can alter the order the changes are recorded in, by
       giving pathnames to git commit. When pathnames are given, the command makes a commit that
       only records the changes made to the named paths:

           $ edit hello.c hello.h
           $ git add hello.c hello.h(press h for help or q to quit)
           $ edit Makefile
           $ git commit Makefile

       This makes a commit that records the modification to Makefile. The changes staged for hello.c
       and hello.h are not included in the resulting commit. However, their changes are not lost —
       they are still staged and merely held back. After the above sequence, if you do:

           $ git commit

       this second commit would record the changes to hello.c and hello.h as expected.

       After a merge (initiated by git merge or git pull) stops because of conflicts, cleanly merged
       paths are already staged to be committed for you, and paths that conflicted are left in
       unmerged state. You would have to first check which paths are conflicting with git status and
       after fixing them manually in your working tree, you would stage the result as usual with git
       add:

           $ git status | grep unmerged
           unmerged: hello.c
           $ edit hello.c
           $ git add hello.c

       After resolving conflicts and staging the result, git ls-files -u would stop mentioning the
       conflicted path. When you are done, run git commit to finally record the merge:

           $ git commit

       As with the case to record your own changes, you can use -a option to save typing. One
       difference is that during a merge resolution, you cannot use git commit with pathnames to
       alter the order the changes are committed, because the merge should be recorded as a single
       commit. In fact, the command refuses to run when given pathnames (but see -i option).

COMMIT INFORMATION
       Author and committer information is taken from the following environment variables, if set:

           GIT_AUTHOR_NAME
           GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL
           GIT_AUTHOR_DATE
           GIT_COMMITTER_NAME
           GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL
           GIT_COMMITTER_DATE

       (nb "<", ">" and "\n"s are stripped)

       The author and committer names are by convention some form of a personal name (that is, the
       name by which other humans refer to you), although Git does not enforce or require any
       particular form. Arbitrary Unicode may be used, subject to the constraints listed above. This
       name has no effect on authentication; for that, see the credential.username variable in git-
       config(1).

       In case (some of) these environment variables are not set, the information is taken from the
       configuration items user.name and user.email, or, if not present, the environment variable
       EMAIL, or, if that is not set, system user name and the hostname used for outgoing mail
       (taken from /etc/mailname and falling back to the fully qualified hostname when that file
       does not exist).

       The author.name and committer.name and their corresponding email options override user.name
       and user.email if set and are overridden themselves by the environment variables.

       The typical usage is to set just the user.name and user.email variables; the other options
       are provided for more complex use cases.

DATE FORMATS
       The GIT_AUTHOR_DATE and GIT_COMMITTER_DATE environment variables support the following date
       formats:

       Git internal format
           It is <unix-timestamp> <time-zone-offset>, where <unix-timestamp> is the number of
           seconds since the UNIX epoch.  <time-zone-offset> is a positive or negative offset from
           UTC. For example CET (which is 1 hour ahead of UTC) is +0100.

       RFC 2822t-commit(1) line 409 (press h for help or q to quit)
           The standard email format as described by RFC 2822, for example Thu, 07 Apr 2005 22:13:13
           +0200.

       ISO 8601
           Time and date specified by the ISO 8601 standard, for example 2005-04-07T22:13:13. The
           parser accepts a space instead of the T character as well. Fractional parts of a second
           will be ignored, for example 2005-04-07T22:13:13.019 will be treated as
           2005-04-07T22:13:13.

               Note
               In addition, the date part is accepted in the following formats: YYYY.MM.DD,
               MM/DD/YYYY and DD.MM.YYYY.

       In addition to recognizing all date formats above, the --date option will also try to make
       sense of other, more human-centric date formats, such as relative dates like "yesterday" or
       "last Friday at noon".

DISCUSSION
       Though not required, it’s a good idea to begin the commit message with a single short (less
       than 50 character) line summarizing the change, followed by a blank line and then a more
       thorough description. The text up to the first blank line in a commit message is treated as
       the commit title, and that title is used throughout Git. For example, git-format-patch(1)
       turns a commit into email, and it uses the title on the Subject line and the rest of the
       commit in the body. line 433 (press h for help or q to quit)

       Git is to some extent character encoding agnostic.

       •   The contents of the blob objects are uninterpreted sequences of bytes. There is no
           encoding translation at the core level.

       •   Path names are encoded in UTF-8 normalization form C. This applies to tree objects, the
           index file, ref names, as well as path names in command line arguments, environment
           variables and config files (.git/config (see git-config(1)), gitignore(5),
           gitattributes(5) and gitmodules(5)).

           Note that Git at the core level treats path names simply as sequences of non-NUL bytes,
           there are no path name encoding conversions (except on Mac and Windows). Therefore, using
           non-ASCII path names will mostly work even on platforms and file systems that use legacy
           extended ASCII encodings. However, repositories created on such systems will not work
           properly on UTF-8-based systems (e.g. Linux, Mac, Windows) and vice versa. Additionally,
           many Git-based tools simply assume path names to be UTF-8 and will fail to display other
           encodings correctly.

       •   Commit log messages are typically encoded in UTF-8, but other extended ASCII encodings
           are also supported. This includes ISO-8859-x, CP125x and many others, but not UTF-16/32,
           EBCDIC and CJK multi-byte encodings (GBK, Shift-JIS, Big5, EUC-x, CP9xx etc.).

       Although we encourage that the commit log messages are encoded in UTF-8, both the core and
       Git Porcelain are designed not to force UTF-8 on projects. If all participants of a
       particular project find it more convenient to use legacy encodings, Git does not forbid it.
       However, there are a few things to keep in mind.

        1. git commit and git commit-tree issues a warning if the commit log message given to it
           does not look like a valid UTF-8 string, unless you explicitly say your project uses a
           legacy encoding. The way to say this is to have i18n.commitEncoding in .git/config file,
           like this:

               [i18n]
                       commitEncoding = ISO-8859-1

           Commit objects created with the above setting record the value of i18n.commitEncoding in
           its encoding header. This is to help other people who look at them later. Lack of this
           header implies that the commit log message is encoded in UTF-8.

        2. git log, git show, git blame and friends look at the encoding header of a commit object,
           and try to re-code the log message into UTF-8 unless otherwise specified. You can specify
           the desired output encoding with i18n.logOutputEncoding in .git/config file, like this:

               [i18n]
                       logOutputEncoding = ISO-8859-1

           If you do not have this configuration variable, the value of i18n.commitEncoding is used
           instead.

       Note that we deliberately chose not to re-code the commit log message when a commit is made
       to force UTF-8 at the commit object level, because re-coding to UTF-8 is not necessarily a
       reversible operation.

ENVIRONMENT AND CONFIGURATION VARIABLES
       The editor used to edit the commit log message will be chosen from the GIT_EDITOR environment
       variable, the core.editor configuration variable, the VISUAL environment variable, or the
       EDITOR environment variable (in that order). See git-var(1) for details.

       Everything above this line in this section isn’t included from the git-config(1)
       documentation. The content that follows is the same as what’s found there:

       commit.cleanup
           This setting overrides the default of the --cleanup option in git commit. See git-
           commit(1) for details. Changing the default can be useful when you always want to keep
           lines that begin with comment character # in your log message, in which case you would do
           git config commit.cleanup whitespace (note that you will have to remove the help lines
           that begin with # in the commit log template yourself, if you do this).

       commit.gpgSign
           A boolean to specify whether all commits should be GPG signed. Use of this option when
           doing operations such as rebase can result in a large number of commits being signed. It
           may be convenient to use an agent to avoid typing your GPG passphrase several times.

       commit.status
           A boolean to enable/disable inclusion of status information in the commit message
           template when using an editor to prepare the commit message. Defaults to true.

       commit.template
           Specify the pathname of a file to use as the template for new commit messages.

       commit.verbose
           A boolean or int to specify the level of verbose with git commit. See git-commit(1).

HOOKS
       This command can run commit-msg, prepare-commit-msg, pre-commit, post-commit and post-rewrite
       hooks. See githooks(5) for more information.

FILES
       $GIT_DIR/COMMIT_EDITMSG
           This file contains the commit message of a commit in progress. If git commit exits due to
           an error before creating a commit, any commit message that has been provided by the user
           (e.g., in an editor session) will be available in this file, but will be overwritten by
           the next invocation of git commit.

DESCRIPTION
       Python is an interpreted, interactive, object-oriented programming language that combines re‐
       markable power with very clear syntax.  For an introduction to programming in Python, see the
       Python  Tutorial.   The  Python Library Reference documents built-in and standard types, con‐
       stants, functions and modules.  Finally, the Python Reference Manual describes the syntax and
       semantics of the core language in (perhaps too) much detail.  (These documents may be located
       via the INTERNET RESOURCES below; they may be installed on your system as well.)
 ESESCOBpage python3(1) line 6 (press h for help or q to quit)
       Python's basic power can be extended with your own modules written in C or C++.  On most sys‐
       tems  such  modules may be dynamically loaded.  Python is also adaptable as an extension lan‐
       guage for existing applications.  See the internal documentation for hints.

NAME
       bash - GNU Bourne-Again SHell

SYNOPSIS
       bash [options] [command_string | file]

COPYRIGHT
       Bash is Copyright (C) 1989-2022 by the Free Software Foundation, Inc.

DESCRIPTION
       Bash  is  an  sh-compatible command language interpreter that executes commands read from the
       standard input or from a file.  Bash also incorporates useful features from the  Korn  and  C
       shells (ksh and csh).

       Bash  is intended to be a conformant implementation of the Shell and Utilities portion of the
       IEEE POSIX specification (IEEE Standard 1003.1).  Bash can be configured to be  POSIX-confor‐
       mant by default.

OPTIONS
       All  of  the  single-character shell options documented in the description of the set builtin
       command, including -o, can be used as options when the shell is invoked.  In  addition,  bash
       interprets the following options when it is invoked:
...skipping...ash(1) line 1 (press h for help or q to quit)

       Comments   and   bug   reports   concerning   this   manual   page   should  be  directed  to
       chet.ramey@case.edu.

BUGS
       It's too big and too slow.

       There are some subtle differences between bash and traditional versions of sh, mostly because
       of the POSIX specification.

       Aliases are confusing in some uses.

       Shell builtin commands and functions are not stoppable/restartable.

       Compound  commands  and  command sequences of the form `a ; b ; c' are not handled gracefully
       when process suspension is attempted.  When a process is stopped, the shell immediately  exe‐
       cutes  the  next  command in the sequence.  It suffices to place the sequence of commands be‐
       tween parentheses to force it into a subshell, which may be stopped as a unit.

       Array variables may not (yet) be exported.

       There may be only one active coprocess at a time.

       exists.   After  reading  that file, it looks for ~/.bash_profile, ~/.bash_login, and ~/.pro‐
       file, in that order, and reads and executes commands from the first one that  exists  and  is
       readable.   The  --noprofile option may be used when the shell is started to inhibit this be‐
       havior.

       When an interactive login shell exits, or a non-interactive login  shell  executes  the  exit
       builtin command, bash reads and executes commands from the file ~/.bash_logout, if it exists.

       When  an interactive shell that is not a login shell is started, bash reads and executes com‐
       mands from /etc/bash.bashrc and ~/.bashrc, if these files exist.  This may  be  inhibited  by
       using  the  --norc option.  The --rcfile file option will force bash to read and execute com‐
       mands from file instead of /etc/bash.bashrc and ~/.bashrc.

       When bash is started non-interactively, to run a shell script, for example, it looks for  the
       variable BASH_ENV in the environment, expands its value if it appears there, and uses the ex‐
       panded value as the name of a file to read and execute.  Bash behaves  as  if  the  following
       command were executed:
              if [ -n "$BASH_ENV" ]; then . "$BASH_ENV"; fi
       but the value of the PATH variable is not used to search for the filename.

       When  the  command history expansion facilities are being used (see HISTORY EXPANSION below),
       the history expansion character, usually !, must be quoted to prevent history expansion.

       There are three quoting mechanisms: the escape character, single quotes, and double quotes.

       A non-quoted backslash (\) is the escape character.  It preserves the literal  value  of  the
       next  character that follows, with the exception of <newline>.  If a \<newline> pair appears,
       and the backslash is not itself quoted, the \<newline> is  treated  as  a  line  continuation
       (that is, it is removed from the input stream and effectively ignored).

       Enclosing  characters  in  single quotes preserves the literal value of each character within
       the quotes.  A single quote may not occur between single quotes,  even  when  preceded  by  a
       backslash.

       Enclosing  characters  in  double quotes preserves the literal value of all characters within
       the quotes, with the exception of $, `, \, and, when history expansion is enabled,  !.   When
       the shell is in posix mode, the ! has no special meaning within double quotes, even when his‐
       tory expansion is enabled.  The characters $ and ` retain their special meaning within double
       quotes.  The backslash retains its special meaning only when followed by one of the following
       characters: $, `, ", \, or <newline>.  A double quote may be quoted within double  quotes  by
       preceding  it  with a backslash.  If enabled, history expansion will be performed unless an !
       appearing in double quotes is escaped using a backslash.  The backslash preceding the  !   is
       not removed.

...skipping...ash(1) line 515 (press h for help or q to quit)
       quote removal (see EXPANSION below).  If the variable has its  integer  attribute  set,  then
       value  is  evaluated  as  an arithmetic expression even if the $((...)) expansion is not used
       (see Arithmetic Expansion below).  Word splitting and pathname expansion are  not  performed.
       Assignment  statements  may  also appear as arguments to the alias, declare, typeset, export,
       readonly, and local builtin commands (declaration  commands).   When  in  posix  mode,  these
       builtins  may  appear in a command after one or more instances of the command builtin and re‐
       tain these assignment statement properties.

       In the context where an assignment statement is assigning a value to a shell variable or  ar‐
       ray  index, the += operator can be used to append to or add to the variable's previous value.
       This includes arguments to builtin commands such as declare that accept assignment statements
       (declaration commands).  When += is applied to a variable for which the integer attribute has
       been set, value is evaluated as an arithmetic expression and added to the variable's  current
       value,  which  is also evaluated.  When += is applied to an array variable using compound as‐
       signment (see Arrays below), the variable's value is not unset (as it is when using  =),  and
       new  values are appended to the array beginning at one greater than the array's maximum index
       (for indexed arrays) or added as additional key-value pairs in an  associative  array.   When
       applied to a string-valued variable, value is expanded and appended to the variable's value.

       A  variable can be assigned the nameref attribute using the -n option to the declare or local
       builtin commands (see the descriptions of declare and local below) to create a nameref, or  a
       reference to another variable.  This allows variables to be manipulated indirectly.  Whenever
       the nameref variable is referenced, assigned to, unset, or has its attributes modified (other
       than  using or changing the nameref attribute itself), the operation is actually performed on
...skipping...ash(1) line 598 (press h for help or q to quit)
       enclosed in braces (see EXPANSION below).

   Special Parameters
       The shell treats several parameters specially.  These parameters may only be referenced;  as‐
       signment to them is not allowed.
       *      Expands  to  the  positional parameters, starting from one.  When the expansion is not
              within double quotes, each positional parameter expands to a separate word.   In  con‐
              texts  where  it  is  performed, those words are subject to further word splitting and
              pathname expansion.  When the expansion occurs within double quotes, it expands  to  a
              single  word  with the value of each parameter separated by the first character of the
              IFS special variable.  That is, "$*" is equivalent to  "$1c$2c...",  where  c  is  the
              first character of the value of the IFS variable.  If IFS is unset, the parameters are
              separated by spaces.  If IFS is null, the parameters are  joined  without  intervening
              separators.
       @      Expands  to  the  positional  parameters,  starting  from one.  In contexts where word
              splitting is performed, this expands each positional parameter to a separate word;  if
              not  within  double  quotes,  these  words are subject to word splitting.  In contexts
              where word splitting is not performed, this expands to a single word with  each  posi‐
              tional  parameter  separated  by  a  space.   When  the expansion occurs within double
              quotes, each parameter expands to a separate word.  That is,  "$@"  is  equivalent  to
              "$1"  "$2"  ...  If the double-quoted expansion occurs within a word, the expansion of
              the first parameter is joined with the beginning part of the original  word,  and  the
              expansion  of  the  last  parameter is joined with the last part of the original word.
              When there are no positional parameters, "$@" and $@ expand to nothing (i.e., they are
...skipping...ash(1) line 645 (press h for help or q to quit)
              TORY EXPANSION below).  The first character is the history  expansion  character,  the
              character  which  signals  the start of a history expansion, normally `!'.  The second
              character is the quick substitution character, which is used as shorthand for  re-run‐
              ning the previous command entered, substituting one string for another in the command.
              The default is `^'.  The optional third character is  the  character  which  indicates
              that  the  remainder  of  the line is a comment when found as the first character of a
              word, normally `#'.  The history comment character causes history substitution  to  be
              skipped  for the remaining words on the line.  It does not necessarily cause the shell
              parser to treat the rest of the line as a comment.

   Arrays
       Bash provides one-dimensional indexed and associative array variables.  Any variable  may  be
       used  as an indexed array; the declare builtin will explicitly declare an array.  There is no
       maximum limit on the size of an array, nor any requirement that members  be  indexed  or  as‐
       signed  contiguously.  Indexed arrays are referenced using integers (including arithmetic ex‐
       pressions) and are zero-based; associative arrays are  referenced  using  arbitrary  strings.
       Unless otherwise noted, indexed array indices must be non-negative integers.

       An  indexed  array  is  created automatically if any variable is assigned to using the syntax
       name[subscript]=value.  The subscript is treated as an arithmetic expression that must evalu‐
       ate  to  a  number.   To  explicitly declare an indexed array, use declare -a name (see SHELL
       BUILTIN COMMANDS below).  declare -a name[subscript] is also accepted; the subscript  is  ig‐
       nored.

...skipping...ash(1) line 1192 (press h for help or q to quit)
       scribed  below  under  EXPANSION.  When assigning to indexed arrays, if the optional brackets
       and subscript are supplied, that index is assigned to; otherwise the index of the element as‐
       signed is the last index assigned to by the statement plus one.  Indexing starts at zero.

       When  assigning to an associative array, the words in a compound assignment may be either as‐
       signment statements, for which the subscript is required, or a list of words that  is  inter‐
       preted  as  a  sequence  of alternating keys and values: name=( key1 value1 key2 value2 ...).
       These are treated identically to name=( [key1]=value1 [key2]=value2 ...).  The first word  in
       the  list  determines how the remaining words are interpreted; all assignments in a list must
       be of the same type.  When using key/value pairs, the keys may not be missing or empty; a fi‐
       nal missing value is treated like the empty string.

       This  syntax  is  also accepted by the declare builtin.  Individual array elements may be as‐
       signed to using the name[subscript]=value syntax introduced above.  When assigning to an  in‐
       dexed array, if name is subscripted by a negative number, that number is interpreted as rela‐
       tive to one greater than the maximum index of name, so negative indices count back  from  the
       end of the array, and an index of -1 references the last element.

       The += operator will append to an array variable when assigning using the compound assignment
       syntax; see PARAMETERS above.

       Any element of an array may be referenced using ${name[subscript]}.  The braces are  required
       to  avoid conflicts with pathname expansion.  If subscript is @ or *, the word expands to all
       members of name.  These subscripts differ only when the word appears  within  double  quotes.
...skipping...ash(1) line 1224 (press h for help or q to quit)
EXPANSION
       Expansion  is  performed  on  the command line after it has been split into words.  There are
       seven kinds of expansion performed: brace expansion, tilde expansion, parameter and  variable
       expansion,  command  substitution,  arithmetic expansion, word splitting, and pathname expan‐
       sion.

       The order of expansions is: brace expansion; tilde expansion, parameter and  variable  expan‐
       sion,  arithmetic expansion, and command substitution (done in a left-to-right fashion); word
       splitting; and pathname expansion.

       On systems that can support it, there is an additional expansion available: process substitu‐
       tion.   This  is performed at the same time as tilde, parameter, variable, and arithmetic ex‐
       pansion and command substitution.

       After these expansions are performed, quote characters present in the original word  are  re‐
       moved unless they have been quoted themselves (quote removal).

       Only brace expansion, word splitting, and pathname expansion can increase the number of words
       of the expansion; other expansions expand a single word to a single word.   The  only  excep‐
       tions  to  this  are  the  expansions  of  "$@"  and "${name[@]}", and, in most cases, $* and
       ${name[*]} as explained above (see PARAMETERS).

   Brace Expansion
       Brace expansion is a mechanism by which arbitrary strings may be generated.   This  mechanism

       scribed below under Tilde Expansion in the EXPANSION section.

       When bash is invoked as an interactive login shell, or as a non-interactive  shell  with  the
       --login option, it first reads and executes commands from the file /etc/profile, if that file
       exists.   After  reading  that file, it looks for ~/.bash_profile, ~/.bash_login, and ~/.pro‐
       file, in that order, and reads and executes commands from the first one that  exists  and  is
       readable.   The  --noprofile option may be used when the shell is started to inhibit this be‐
       havior.

       When an interactive login shell exits, or a non-interactive login  shell  executes  the  exit
       builtin command, bash reads and executes commands from the file ~/.bash_logout, if it exists.

       When  an interactive shell that is not a login shell is started, bash reads and executes com‐
       mands from /etc/bash.bashrc and ~/.bashrc, if these files exist.  This may  be  inhibited  by
       using  the  --norc option.  The --rcfile file option will force bash to read and execute com‐
       mands from file instead of /etc/bash.bashrc and ~/.bashrc.

       When bash is started non-interactively, to run a shell script, for example, it looks for  the
       variable BASH_ENV in the environment, expands its value if it appears there, and uses the ex‐
       panded  value  as  the  name of a file to read and execute.  Bash behaves as if the following
       command were executed:
              if [ -n "$BASH_ENV" ]; then . "$BASH_ENV"; fi
       but the value of the PATH variable is not used to search for the filename.

       When the command history expansion facilities are being used (see HISTORY  EXPANSION  below),
       the history expansion character, usually !, must be quoted to prevent history expansion.

       There are three quoting mechanisms: the escape character, single quotes, and double quotes.

       A  non-quoted  backslash  (\) is the escape character.  It preserves the literal value of the
       next character that follows, with the exception of <newline>.  If a \<newline> pair  appears,
       and  the  backslash  is  not  itself quoted, the \<newline> is treated as a line continuation
       (that is, it is removed from the input stream and effectively ignored).

       Enclosing characters in single quotes preserves the literal value of  each  character  within
       the  quotes.   A  single  quote  may not occur between single quotes, even when preceded by a
       backslash.

       Enclosing characters in double quotes preserves the literal value of  all  characters  within
       the  quotes,  with the exception of $, `, \, and, when history expansion is enabled, !.  When
       the shell is in posix mode, the ! has no special meaning within double quotes, even when his‐
       tory expansion is enabled.  The characters $ and ` retain their special meaning within double
       quotes.  The backslash retains its special meaning only when followed by one of the following
       characters: $, `, ", \, or <newline>.  A double quote may be quoted within double  quotes  by
       preceding  it  with a backslash.  If enabled, history expansion will be performed unless an !
       appearing in double quotes is escaped using a backslash.  The backslash preceding the  !   is
       not removed.

...skipping...ash(1) line 515 (press h for help or q to quit)
       quote removal (see EXPANSION below).  If the variable has its  integer  attribute  set,  then
       value  is  evaluated  as  an arithmetic expression even if the $((...)) expansion is not used
       (see Arithmetic Expansion below).  Word splitting and pathname expansion are  not  performed.
       Assignment  statements  may  also appear as arguments to the alias, declare, typeset, export,
       readonly, and local builtin commands (declaration  commands).   When  in  posix  mode,  these
       builtins  may  appear in a command after one or more instances of the command builtin and re‐
       tain these assignment statement properties.

       In the context where an assignment statement is assigning a value to a shell variable or  ar‐
       ray  index, the += operator can be used to append to or add to the variable's previous value.
       This includes arguments to builtin commands such as declare that accept assignment statements
       (declaration commands).  When += is applied to a variable for which the integer attribute has
       been set, value is evaluated as an arithmetic expression and added to the variable's  current
       value,  which  is also evaluated.  When += is applied to an array variable using compound as‐
       signment (see Arrays below), the variable's value is not unset (as it is when using  =),  and
       new  values are appended to the array beginning at one greater than the array's maximum index
       (for indexed arrays) or added as additional key-value pairs in an  associative  array.   When
       applied to a string-valued variable, value is expanded and appended to the variable's value.

       A  variable can be assigned the nameref attribute using the -n option to the declare or local
       builtin commands (see the descriptions of declare and local below) to create a nameref, or  a
       reference to another variable.  This allows variables to be manipulated indirectly.  Whenever
       the nameref variable is referenced, assigned to, unset, or has its attributes modified (other
       than  using or changing the nameref attribute itself), the operation is actually performed on

       enclosed in braces (see EXPANSION below).

   Special Parameters
       The shell treats several parameters specially.  These parameters may only be referenced;  as‐
       signment to them is not allowed.
       *      Expands  to  the  positional parameters, starting from one.  When the expansion is not
              within double quotes, each positional parameter expands to a separate word.   In  con‐
              texts  where  it  is  performed, those words are subject to further word splitting and
              pathname expansion.  When the expansion occurs within double quotes, it expands  to  a
              single  word  with the value of each parameter separated by the first character of the
              IFS special variable.  That is, "$*" is equivalent to  "$1c$2c...",  where  c  is  the
              first character of the value of the IFS variable.  If IFS is unset, the parameters are
              separated  by  spaces.   If IFS is null, the parameters are joined without intervening
              separators.
       @      Expands to the positional parameters, starting  from  one.   In  contexts  where  word
              splitting  is performed, this expands each positional parameter to a separate word; if
              not within double quotes, these words are subject  to  word  splitting.   In  contexts
              where  word  splitting is not performed, this expands to a single word with each posi‐
              tional parameter separated by a  space.   When  the  expansion  occurs  within  double
              quotes,  each  parameter  expands  to a separate word.  That is, "$@" is equivalent to
              "$1" "$2" ...  If the double-quoted expansion occurs within a word, the  expansion  of
              the  first  parameter  is joined with the beginning part of the original word, and the
              expansion of the last parameter is joined with the last part  of  the  original  word.
              When there are no positional parameters, "$@" and $@ expand to nothing (i.e., they are
...skipping...ash(1) line 645 (press h for help or q to quit)
              TORY  EXPANSION  below).   The first character is the history expansion character, the
              character which signals the start of a history expansion, normally  `!'.   The  second
              character  is the quick substitution character, which is used as shorthand for re-run‐
              ning the previous command entered, substituting one string for another in the command.
              The default is `^'.  The optional third character is  the  character  which  indicates
              that  the  remainder  of  the line is a comment when found as the first character of a
              word, normally `#'.  The history comment character causes history substitution  to  be
              skipped  for the remaining words on the line.  It does not necessarily cause the shell
              parser to treat the rest of the line as a comment.

   Arrays
       Bash provides one-dimensional indexed and associative array variables.  Any variable  may  be
       used  as an indexed array; the declare builtin will explicitly declare an array.  There is no
       maximum limit on the size of an array, nor any requirement that members  be  indexed  or  as‐
       signed  contiguously.  Indexed arrays are referenced using integers (including arithmetic ex‐
       pressions) and are zero-based; associative arrays are  referenced  using  arbitrary  strings.
       Unless otherwise noted, indexed array indices must be non-negative integers.

       An  indexed  array  is  created automatically if any variable is assigned to using the syntax
       name[subscript]=value.  The subscript is treated as an arithmetic expression that must evalu‐
       ate to a number.  To explicitly declare an indexed array, use  declare  -a  name  (see  SHELL
       BUILTIN  COMMANDS  below).  declare -a name[subscript] is also accepted; the subscript is ig‐
       nored.

...skipping...ash(1) line 1192 (press h for help or q to quit)
       scribed  below  under  EXPANSION.  When assigning to indexed arrays, if the optional brackets
       and subscript are supplied, that index is assigned to; otherwise the index of the element as‐
       signed is the last index assigned to by the statement plus one.  Indexing starts at zero.

       When assigning to an associative array, the words in a compound assignment may be either  as‐
       signment  statements,  for which the subscript is required, or a list of words that is inter‐
       preted as a sequence of alternating keys and values: name=( key1  value1  key2  value2  ...).
       These  are treated identically to name=( [key1]=value1 [key2]=value2 ...).  The first word in
       the list determines how the remaining words are interpreted; all assignments in a  list  must
       be of the same type.  When using key/value pairs, the keys may not be missing or empty; a fi‐
       nal missing value is treated like the empty string.

       This  syntax  is  also accepted by the declare builtin.  Individual array elements may be as‐
       signed to using the name[subscript]=value syntax introduced above.  When assigning to an  in‐
       dexed array, if name is subscripted by a negative number, that number is interpreted as rela‐
       tive  to  one greater than the maximum index of name, so negative indices count back from the
       end of the array, and an index of -1 references the last element.

       The += operator will append to an array variable when assigning using the compound assignment
       syntax; see PARAMETERS above.

       Any element of an array may be referenced using ${name[subscript]}.  The braces are  required
       to  avoid conflicts with pathname expansion.  If subscript is @ or *, the word expands to all
       members of name.  These subscripts differ only when the word appears  within  double  quotes.

EXPANSION
       Expansion  is  performed  on  the command line after it has been split into words.  There are
       seven kinds of expansion performed: brace expansion, tilde expansion, parameter and  variable
       expansion,  command  substitution,  arithmetic expansion, word splitting, and pathname expan‐
       sion.

       The order of expansions is: brace expansion; tilde expansion, parameter and  variable  expan‐
       sion,  arithmetic expansion, and command substitution (done in a left-to-right fashion); word
       splitting; and pathname expansion.

       On systems that can support it, there is an additional expansion available: process substitu‐
       tion.  This is performed at the same time as tilde, parameter, variable, and  arithmetic  ex‐
       pansion and command substitution.

       After  these  expansions are performed, quote characters present in the original word are re‐
       moved unless they have been quoted themselves (quote removal).

       Only brace expansion, word splitting, and pathname expansion can increase the number of words
       of the expansion; other expansions expand a single word to a single word.   The  only  excep‐
       tions  to  this  are  the  expansions  of  "$@"  and "${name[@]}", and, in most cases, $* and
       ${name[*]} as explained above (see PARAMETERS).

   Brace Expansion
       Brace expansion is a mechanism by which arbitrary strings may be generated.   This  mechanism
