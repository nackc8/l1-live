                 builtin (see SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS below).  If  shopt_option  is
                 present,  -O  sets  the  value  of that option; +O unsets it.  If
                 shopt_option is not supplied, the names and values of  the  shell
                 options accepted by shopt are printed on the standard output.  If
                 the invocation option is +O, the output is displayed in a  format
                 that may be reused as input.
       --        A  -- signals the end of options and disables further option pro‐
                 cessing.  Any arguments after the -- are treated as filenames and
                 arguments.  An argument of - is equivalent to --.

       Bash  also  interprets  a number of multi-character options.  These options
       must appear on the command line before the single-character options  to  be
       recognized.

       mand (see declare below in SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS).

       A  parameter  is set if it has been assigned a value.  The null string is a
       valid value.  Once a variable is set, it may be unset only by using the un‐
       set builtin command (see SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS below).

       A variable may be assigned to by a statement of the form

              name=[value]

       If  value is not given, the variable is assigned the null string.  All val‐
       ues undergo tilde expansion, parameter and variable expansion, command sub‐
       stitution,  arithmetic  expansion, and quote removal (see EXPANSION below).
       If the variable has its integer attribute set, then value is  evaluated  as
       an  arithmetic  expression  even if the $((...)) expansion is not used (see
       Arithmetic Expansion below).  Word splitting and pathname expansion are not
       performed.   Assignment  statements  may  also  appear  as arguments to the
       alias, declare, typeset, export, readonly, and local builtin commands (dec‐
       laration  commands).   When  in  posix mode, these builtins may appear in a
...skipping...ash(1) line 671 (press h for help or q to quit)
              mand  (see  SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS below).  The options appearing in
              BASHOPTS are those reported as on by shopt.  If this variable is  in
              the  environment  when bash starts up, each shell option in the list
              will be enabled before reading any startup files.  This variable  is
              read-only.
       BASHPID
              Expands to the process ID of the current bash process.  This differs
              from $$ under certain circumstances, such as subshells that  do  not
              require  bash  to be re-initialized.  Assignments to BASHPID have no
              effect.  If BASHPID is unset, it loses its special properties,  even
              if it is subsequently reset.
       BASH_ALIASES
              An associative array variable whose members correspond to the inter‐
              nal list of aliases as maintained by the  alias  builtin.   Elements
              added to this array appear in the alias list; however, unsetting ar‐
...skipping...ash(1) line 799 (press h for help or q to quit)
              builtin command (see SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS below).
       OPTIND The  index  of  the  next  argument  to  be processed by the getopts
              builtin command (see SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS below).
       OSTYPE Automatically set to a string that describes the operating system on
              which bash is executing.  The default is system-dependent.
       PIPESTATUS
              An  array variable (see Arrays below) containing a list of exit sta‐
              tus values from the processes in  the  most-recently-executed  fore‐
              ground pipeline (which may contain only a single command).
       PPID   The process ID of the shell's parent.  This variable is readonly.
       PWD    The current working directory as set by the cd command.
       RANDOM Each time this parameter is referenced, it expands to a random inte‐
              ger between 0 and 32767.  Assigning a value  to  RANDOM  initializes
              (seeds)  the  sequence  of  random  numbers.  If RANDOM is unset, it
              loses its special properties, even if it is subsequently reset.
       READLINE_ARGUMENTe 1007 (press h for help or q to quit)
              Any numeric argument given to a readline command  that  was  defined
              using  "bind  -x" (see SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS below) when it was in‐
              voked.
       READLINE_LINE
              The contents of the readline line buffer, for  use  with  "bind  -x"
              (see SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS below).
       READLINE_MARK
              The  position  of  the  mark (saved insertion point) in the readline
              line buffer, for use with "bind -x" (see SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS  be‐
              low).   The  characters between the insertion point and the mark are
              often called the region.
       READLINE_POINT
              The position of the insertion point in the readline line buffer, for
              use with "bind -x" (see SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS below).
       REPLY  Set  to  the  line of input read by the read builtin command when no
              arguments are supplied.
       SECONDSash(1) line 1024 (press h for help or q to quit)
              Each time this parameter is referenced, it expands to the number  of
              seconds  since shell invocation.  If a value is assigned to SECONDS,
              the value returned upon subsequent references is the number of  sec‐
              onds  since  the  assignment plus the value assigned.  The number of
              seconds at shell invocation and the current time are  always  deter‐
              mined  by  querying the system clock.  If SECONDS is unset, it loses
              its special properties, even if it is subsequently reset.
       SHELLOPTS
              A colon-separated list of enabled shell options.  Each word  in  the
              list  is  a valid argument for the -o option to the set builtin com‐
              mand (see SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS below).  The options  appearing  in
              SHELLOPTS  are  those reported as on by set -o.  If this variable is
              in the environment when bash starts up, each  shell  option  in  the
              list  will  be enabled before reading any startup files.  This vari‐
              able is read-only.
       SHLVL  Incremented by one each time an instance of bash is started.
       SRANDOM
              This variable expands to a 32-bit pseudo-random number each time  it
              is  referenced. The random number generator is not linear on systems
              that support /dev/urandom or arc4random, so each returned number has
              no relationship to the numbers preceding it.  The random number gen‐
              erator cannot be seeded, so assignments to this variable have no ef‐
              fect.  If SRANDOM is unset, it loses its special properties, even if
              it is subsequently reset.
       UID    Expands to the user ID of the current  user,  initialized  at  shell
...skipping...ash(1) line 1050 (press h for help or q to quit)
              getopts  builtin command (see SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS below).  OPTERR
              is initialized to 1 each time the shell is invoked or a shell script
              is executed.
       PATH   The  search  path for commands.  It is a colon-separated list of di‐
              rectories in which the shell looks for commands (see COMMAND  EXECU‐
              TION  below).   A  zero-length (null) directory name in the value of
              PATH indicates the current directory.  A null directory name may ap‐
              pear  as  two  adjacent  colons, or as an initial or trailing colon.
              The default path is system-dependent, and is set by the  administra‐
              tor who installs bash.  A common value is ``/usr/local/bin:/usr/lo‐
              cal/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin:/bin:/sbin''.
       POSIXLY_CORRECT
              If this variable is in the environment when bash starts,  the  shell
              enters  posix  mode  before  reading  the  startup  files, as if the
              --posix invocation option had been supplied.  If it is set while the
...skipping...ash(1) line 1281 (press h for help or q to quit)
       clare an indexed array, use declare -a name (see SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS be‐
       low).  declare -a name[subscript] is also accepted; the  subscript  is  ig‐
       nored.

       Associative arrays are created using declare -A name.

       Attributes  may  be  specified  for an array variable using the declare and
       readonly builtins.  Each attribute applies to all members of an array.

       Arrays are assigned to using compound assignments of the form  name=(value1
       ...  valuen),  where each value may be of the form [subscript]=string.  In‐
       dexed array assignments do not require anything but string.  Each value  in
       the  list  is expanded using all the shell expansions described below under
       EXPANSION.  When assigning to indexed arrays, if the optional brackets  and
       subscript  are  supplied, that index is assigned to; otherwise the index of

       under SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS below).

       The rules concerning the definition and use of aliases are somewhat confus‐
       ing.  Bash always reads at least one complete line of input, and all  lines
       that  make  up  a compound command, before executing any of the commands on
       that line or the compound command.  Aliases are expanded when a command  is
       read, not when it is executed.  Therefore, an alias definition appearing on
       the same line as another command does not take effect until the  next  line
       of input is read.  The commands following the alias definition on that line
       are not affected by the new alias.  This behavior is  also  an  issue  when
       functions are executed.  Aliases are expanded when a function definition is
       read, not when the function is executed, because a function  definition  is
       itself  a command.  As a consequence, aliases defined in a function are not
       available until after that function is executed.  To be  safe,  always  put
       alias definitions on a separate line, and do not use alias in compound com‐
...skipping...ash(1) line 2356 (press h for help or q to quit)
       (see  the  description of the trap builtin under SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS be‐
       low) are not inherited unless the function has been given the trace  attri‐
       bute (see the description of the declare builtin below) or the -o functrace
       shell option has been enabled with the set builtin (in which case all func‐
       tions  inherit  the DEBUG and RETURN traps), and the ERR trap is not inher‐
       ited unless the -o errtrace shell option has been enabled.

       Variables local to the function may be declared with the local builtin com‐
       mand  (local variables).  Ordinarily, variables and their values are shared
       between the function and its caller.  If a variable is declared local,  the
       variable's  visible  scope  is restricted to that function and its children
       (including the functions it calls).

       In the following description, the current scope is a  currently-  executing
       function.   Previous  scopes  consist  of that function's caller and so on,
...skipping...ash(1) line 2389 (press h for help or q to quit)
       der SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS) are retained by the child.

       If the program is a file beginning with #!, the remainder of the first line
       specifies an interpreter for the program.  The shell executes the specified
       interpreter  on operating systems that do not handle this executable format
       themselves.  The arguments to the interpreter consist of a single  optional
       argument  following  the interpreter name on the first line of the program,
       followed by the name of the program, followed by the command arguments,  if
       any.

COMMAND EXECUTION ENVIRONMENT
       The shell has an execution environment, which consists of the following:

       •      open  files  inherited  by  the  shell at invocation, as modified by
              redirections supplied to the exec builtin
...skipping...ash(1) line 2705 (press h for help or q to quit)
       the  description  of the shopt command under SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS below).
       This can have unwanted side effects if escaped portions of the  string  ap‐
       pear  within command substitution or contain characters special to word ex‐
       pansion.

READLINE
       This is the library that handles reading input when  using  an  interactive
       shell,  unless  the  --noediting option is given at shell invocation.  Line
       editing is also used when using the -e option to the read builtin.  By  de‐
       fault, the line editing commands are similar to those of Emacs.  A vi-style
       line editing interface is also available.  Line editing can be  enabled  at
       any  time using the -o emacs or -o vi options to the set builtin (see SHELL
       BUILTIN COMMANDS below).  To turn off line editing after the shell is  run‐
       ning, use the +o emacs or +o vi options to the set builtin.

...skipping...ash(1) line 3031 (press h for help or q to quit)
       or using the bind builtin command (see SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS below).

       Except where noted, readline variables can take the values On or Off (with‐
       out  regard  to  case).   Unrecognized  variable names are ignored.  When a
       variable value is read, empty or null values, "on" (case-insensitive),  and
       "1"  are  equivalent  to  On.  All other values are equivalent to Off.  The
       variables and their default values are:

       active-region-start-color
              A string variable that controls the text color and  background  when
              displaying the text in the active region (see the description of en‐
              able-active-region below).  This string must not take up any  physi‐
              cal character positions on the display, so it should consist only of
              terminal escape sequences.  It is output to the terminal before dis‐
              playing  the  text  in the active region.  This variable is reset to
...skipping...ash(1) line 3169 (press h for help or q to quit)
       builtin (see SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS below), the programmable completion fa‐
       cilities are invoked.

       First, the command name is identified.  If the command word  is  the  empty
       string  (completion attempted at the beginning of an empty line), any comp‐
       spec defined with the -E option to complete is used.   If  a  compspec  has
       been defined for that command, the compspec is used to generate the list of
       possible completions for the word.  If the command word is a full pathname,
       a  compspec for the full pathname is searched for first.  If no compspec is
       found for the full pathname, an attempt is made to find a compspec for  the
       portion  following  the  final slash.  If those searches do not result in a
       compspec, any compspec defined with the -D option to complete  is  used  as
       the  default.   If there is no default compspec, bash attempts alias expan‐
       sion on the command word as a final resort, and attempts to find a compspec
       for the command word from any successful expansion.
...skipping...ash(1) line 3983 (press h for help or q to quit)
       The builtin command fc (see SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS below) may  be  used  to
       list  or  edit  and  re-execute a portion of the history list.  The history
       builtin may be used to display or modify the history  list  and  manipulate
       the  history  file.   When  using command-line editing, search commands are
       available in each editing mode that provide access to the history list.

       The shell allows control over which commands are saved on the history list.
       The  HISTCONTROL  and HISTIGNORE variables may be set to cause the shell to
       save only a subset of the commands entered.  The cmdhist shell  option,  if
       enabled, causes the shell to attempt to save each line of a multi-line com‐
       mand in the same history entry, adding semicolons where necessary  to  pre‐
       serve  syntactic correctness.  The lithist shell option causes the shell to
       save the command with embedded newlines instead of semicolons.  See the de‐
       scription  of  the shopt builtin below under SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS for in‐
       formation on setting and unsetting shell options.
/Manual page bash(1) line 4137 (press h for help or q to quit)
HISTORY EXPANSION
       The shell supports a history expansion feature that is similar to the  his‐
       tory  expansion  in  csh.   This section describes what syntax features are
       available.  This feature is enabled by default for interactive shells,  and
       can  be  disabled using the +H option to the set builtin command (see SHELL
       BUILTIN COMMANDS below).  Non-interactive shells do not perform history ex‐
       pansion by default.

       History  expansions  introduce  words  from the history list into the input
       stream, making it easy to repeat commands, insert the arguments to a previ‐
       ous command into the current input line, or fix errors in previous commands
       quickly.
...skipping...ash(1) line 4150 (press h for help or q to quit)
SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS
       Unless otherwise noted, each builtin command documented in this section  as
       accepting  options  preceded  by - accepts -- to signify the end of the op‐
       tions.  The :, true, false, and test/[ builtins do not accept  options  and
       do not treat -- specially.  The exit, logout, return, break, continue, let,
       and shift builtins accept and process arguments beginning  with  -  without
       requiring  --.   Other builtins that accept arguments but are not specified
       as accepting options interpret arguments beginning with -  as  invalid  op‐
       tions and require -- to prevent this interpretation.
       : [arguments]
              No  effect;  the command does nothing beyond expanding arguments and
              performing any specified redirections.  The return status is zero.

        .  filename [arguments]
       source filename [arguments]
              Read and execute commands from filename in the current  shell  envi‐
              ronment and return the exit status of the last command executed from
              filename.  If filename does not contain a slash, filenames  in  PATH
              are  used  to  find  the directory containing filename, but filename
              does not need to be executable.  The file searched for in PATH  need
              not  be executable.  When bash is not in posix mode, it searches the
              current directory if no file is found in PATH.   If  the  sourcepath
              option  to  the shopt builtin command is turned off, the PATH is not
              searched.  If any arguments are supplied, they become the positional
              parameters  when filename is executed.  Otherwise the positional pa‐
              rameters are unchanged.  If the -T option is enabled, . inherits any
              trap  on DEBUG; if it is not, any DEBUG trap string is saved and re‐
              stored around the call to ., and . unsets the DEBUG  trap  while  it
              executes.   If -T is not set, and the sourced file changes the DEBUG
              trap, the new value is retained when . completes.  The return status
              is  the status of the last command exited within the script (0 if no
              commands are executed), and false if filename is not found or cannot
              be read.ine 4308 (press h for help or q to quit)

       alias [-p] [name[=value] ...]s h for help or q to quit)
              Alias  with  no  arguments  or with the -p option prints the list of
              aliases in the form alias name=value on standard output.  When argu‐
              ments are supplied, an alias is defined for each name whose value is
              given.  A trailing space in value causes the next word to be checked

              Invokes a shell to run the shell-command given.  A percent sign  (%)

       Options are also taken from the environment variable "LESS".  For  example,

       such, and to prevent parameter expansion.

       Each of the metacharacters listed above under DEFINITIONS has special mean‐
       ing to the shell and must be quoted if it is to represent itself.

       When the command history expansion facilities are being used  (see  HISTORY
       EXPANSION  below),  the  history  expansion  character,  usually !, must be
       quoted to prevent history expansion.

       There are three quoting mechanisms: the escape  character,  single  quotes,
       and double quotes.

       A  non-quoted backslash (\) is the escape character.  It preserves the lit‐
       eral value of the next character that follows, with the exception of  <new‐
       line>.   If  a  \<newline>  pair  appears,  and the backslash is not itself

              parameter expansion, command substitution, and arithmetic  expansion
              before  being interpreted as a filename.  PATH is not used to search
              for the resultant filename.
       BASH_XTRACEFD
              If set to an integer corresponding to a valid file descriptor,  bash
              will write the trace output generated when set -x is enabled to that
              file descriptor.  The file descriptor is closed  when  BASH_XTRACEFD
              is  unset  or  assigned a new value.  Unsetting BASH_XTRACEFD or as‐
              signing it the empty string causes the trace output to  be  sent  to
              the standard error.  Note that setting BASH_XTRACEFD to 2 (the stan‐
              dard error file descriptor) and then unsetting it will result in the
              standard error being closed.
       CDPATH The  search path for the cd command.  This is a colon-separated list
              of directories in which the shell looks for destination  directories
              specified by the cd command.  A sample value is ".:~:/usr".
...skipping...ash(1) line 1089 (press h for help or q to quit)
       pression.  To avoid conflicts with parameter expansion, the  string  ${  is
       not  considered  eligible for brace expansion, and inhibits brace expansion
       until the closing }.

       This construct is typically used as shorthand when the common prefix of the
       strings to be generated is longer than in the above example:

              mkdir /usr/local/src/bash/{old,new,dist,bugs}
       or
              chown root /usr/{ucb/{ex,edit},lib/{ex?.?*,how_ex}}

       Brace  expansion  introduces  a slight incompatibility with historical ver‐
       sions of sh.  sh does not treat opening or closing  braces  specially  when
       they  appear as part of a word, and preserves them in the output.  Bash re‐
       moves braces from words as a consequence of brace expansion.  For  example,
...skipping...ash(1) line 1559 (press h for help or q to quit)
   Parameter Expansion
       The `$' character introduces parameter expansion, command substitution,  or
       arithmetic  expansion.   The parameter name or symbol to be expanded may be
       enclosed in braces, which are optional but serve to protect the variable to
       be  expanded from characters immediately following it which could be inter‐
       preted as part of the name.

       When braces are used, the matching ending brace is the first  `}'  not  es‐
       caped  by a backslash or within a quoted string, and not within an embedded
       arithmetic expansion, command substitution, or parameter expansion.

       ${parameter}
              The value of parameter is substituted.  The braces are required when
              parameter  is  a  positional  parameter with more than one digit, or
              when parameter is followed by a character which is not to be  inter‐
              preted  as  part of its name.  The parameter is a shell parameter as
              described above PARAMETERS) or an array reference (Arrays).

       If the first character of parameter is an exclamation point (!), and param‐
       eter is not a nameref, it introduces a level of indirection.  Bash uses the
       value formed by expanding the rest of parameter as the new parameter;  this
       is  then  expanded  and  that  value  is used in the rest of the expansion,
       rather than the expansion of the original parameter.  This is known as  in‐
       direct  expansion.   The value is subject to tilde expansion, parameter ex‐
...skipping...ash(1) line 1623 (press h for help or q to quit)
       The  shell  scans the results of parameter expansion, command substitution,
       and arithmetic expansion that did not occur within double quotes  for  word
       splitting.

       The  shell  treats each character of IFS as a delimiter, and splits the re‐
       sults of the other expansions into words using these  characters  as  field
       terminators.   If  IFS  is unset, or its value is exactly <space><tab><new‐
       line>, the default, then sequences of <space>, <tab>, and <newline> at  the
       beginning  and  end  of the results of the previous expansions are ignored,
       and any sequence of IFS characters not at the beginning or  end  serves  to
       delimit  words.   If IFS has a value other than the default, then sequences
       of the whitespace characters space, tab, and newline are ignored at the be‐
       ginning  and end of the word, as long as the whitespace character is in the
       value of IFS (an IFS whitespace character).  Any character in IFS  that  is
       not  IFS whitespace, along with any adjacent IFS whitespace characters, de‐
...skipping...ash(1) line 1940 (press h for help or q to quit)
       Shell  variables  are allowed as operands; parameter expansion is performed
       before the expression is evaluated.  Within an expression, shell  variables
       may  also  be referenced by name without using the parameter expansion syn‐
       tax.  A shell variable that is null or unset evaluates to 0 when referenced
       by name without using the parameter expansion syntax.  The value of a vari‐
       able is evaluated as an arithmetic expression when  it  is  referenced,  or
       when a variable which has been given the integer attribute using declare -i
       is assigned a value.  A null value evaluates to 0.  A shell  variable  need
       not have its integer attribute turned on to be used in an expression.

       Integer  constants  follow  the  C language definition, without suffixes or
       character constants.  Constants with a leading 0 are interpreted  as  octal
       numbers.   A leading 0x or 0X denotes hexadecimal.  Otherwise, numbers take
       the form [base#]n, where the optional base is a decimal  number  between  2
       and  64  representing  the arithmetic base, and n is a number in that base.
       If base# is omitted, then base 10 is used.  When specifying n,  if  a  non-
       digit  is required, the digits greater than 9 are represented by the lower‐
       case letters, the uppercase letters, @, and _, in that order.  If  base  is
       less  than  or equal to 36, lowercase and uppercase letters may be used in‐

              pansion, parameter expansion, command substitution,  arithmetic  ex‐
              pansion, and quote removal before being assigned to the variable.

       If  no  command  name  results, the variable assignments affect the current
       shell environment.  In the case of such a command (one that  consists  only
       of  assignment statements and redirections), assignment statements are per‐
       formed before redirections.  Otherwise, the variables are added to the  en‐
       vironment of the executed command and do not affect the current shell envi‐
       ronment.  If any of the assignments attempts to assign a value to  a  read‐
       only  variable, an error occurs, and the command exits with a non-zero sta‐
       tus.

       If no command name results, redirections are performed, but do  not  affect
       the  current  shell environment.  A redirection error causes the command to
       exit with a non-zero status.

READLINE
       This is the library that handles reading input when  using  an  interactive
       shell,  unless  the  --noediting option is given at shell invocation.  Line
       editing is also used when using the -e option to the read builtin.  By  de‐
       fault, the line editing commands are similar to those of Emacs.  A vi-style
       line editing interface is also available.  Line editing can be  enabled  at

                      If expansion is attempted on an unset variable or parameter,
                      the  shell prints an error message, and, if not interactive,
                      exits with a non-zero status.

                      mand, select command, or arithmetic for command, display the
                      expanded value of PS4, followed by the command and  its  ex‐
                      panded arguments or associated word list.
              -B      The  shell  performs  brace  expansion  (see Brace Expansion
                      above).  This is on by default.
              -C      If set, bash does not overwrite an existing file with the >,
                      >&,  and  <>  redirection operators.  This may be overridden
                      when creating output files by using the redirection operator
                      >| instead of >.

                      pattern, as described under Parameter Expansion above.  This
                      option is enabled by default.

              progcomp
                      If set, the programmable completion facilities (see Program‐
                      mable Completion above) are enabled.  This option is enabled
                      by default.

              progcomp_alias
                      If  set, and programmable completion is enabled, bash treats
                      a command name that doesn't have any completions as a possi‐
                      ble  alias and attempts alias expansion. If it has an alias,
                      bash attempts programmable completion using the command word
                      resulting from the expanded alias.

...skipping...ash(1) line 5833 (press h for help or q to quit)
                      If  set, prompt strings undergo parameter expansion, command
                      substitution, arithmetic expansion, and quote removal  after
                      being expanded as described in PROMPTING above.  This option
                      is enabled by default.

              restricted_shell
                      The shell sets this option if it is  started  in  restricted
                      mode  (see  RESTRICTED  SHELL  below).  The value may not be
                      changed.  This is not reset when the startup files are  exe‐
                      cuted, allowing the startup files to discover whether or not
                      a shell is restricted.

              shift_verbose
                      If set, the shift builtin prints an error message  when  the
                      shift count exceeds the number of positional parameters.

       -e or --quit-at-eof
              Causes less to automatically exit the second time it reaches end-of-
              file.  By default, the only way to exit less is via the "q" command.

       -E or --QUIT-AT-EOF
              Causes less to automatically exit the first time it reaches  end-of-
              file.

       -f or --force
              Forces non-regular files to be opened.  (A non-regular file is a di‐
              rectory or a device special file.)  Also suppresses the warning mes‐
              sage  when a binary file is opened.  By default, less will refuse to

              Causes  less  to  automatically  exit if the entire file can be dis‐
              played on the first screen.

       -g or --hilite-search
              Normally, less will highlight  ALL  strings  which  match  the  last
              search  command.   The  -g option changes this behavior to highlight
              only the particular string which was found by the last  search  com‐
              mand.  This can cause less to run somewhat faster than the default.

       -G or --HILITE-SEARCH
              The -G option suppresses all highlighting of strings found by search
              commands.

       -hn or --max-back-scroll=n
...skipping...ess(1) line 634 (press h for help or q to quit)
       -i or --ignore-case
              Causes searches to ignore case; that is, uppercase and lowercase are
              considered identical.  This option is ignored if any uppercase  let‐
              ters appear in the search pattern; in other words, if a pattern con‐
              tains uppercase letters, then that search does not ignore case.

       -I or --IGNORE-CASE
              Like -i, but searches ignore case even if the pattern  contains  up‐
              percase letters.

       -jn or --jump-target=n
              Specifies  a line on the screen where the "target" line is to be po‐
              sitioned.  The target line is the line specified by any  command  to
              search for a pattern, jump to a line number, jump to a file percent‐
              age or jump to a tag.  The screen line may be specified by a number:

DESCRIPTIONe bash(1) line 4 (press h for help or q to quit)
       Bash  is  an  sh-compatible command language interpreter that executes com‐
       mands read from the standard input or from a file.  Bash also  incorporates
       useful features from the Korn and C shells (ksh and csh).
 ESESCOBpage bash(1) line 8 (press h for help or q to quit)
       Bash  is intended to be a conformant implementation of the Shell and Utili‐
       ties portion of the IEEE POSIX specification (IEEE Standard 1003.1).   Bash
       can be configured to be POSIX-conformant by default.)

NAMN
       top — visa Linuxprocesser

SYNOPSIS
       top [flaggor]

BESKRIVNING
       Programmet  top visar en dynamisk vy av det körande systemet i realtid. Det
       kan visa sammanfattande  information  om  systemet  liksom  en  lista  över
       processer  eller trådar som för närvarande hanteras av Linuxkärnan. Typerna
       av sammanfattande systeminformation som visas och  typerna,  ordningen  och
       storleken     på    informationen    som    visas    för    processer    är
       användarkonfigurerbart  och  den   konfigurationen   kan   bevaras   mellan
       omstarter.1) line 2 (press h for help or q to quit)
 ESESCOBpage top(1) line 3 (press h for help or q to quit)
       Programmet  ger  ett  begränsat interaktivt gränssnitt för processhantering
       såväl som ett mycket mer omfattande gränssnitt för personlig  konfiguration
        —   omfattande  dess  funktion  i  alla  avseenden.  Och medan top rereras
       genomgående i detta dokument står det dig fritt att kalla programmet vad du
       vill. Det nya namnet, möjligen  ett  alias,  kan  sedan  avspeglas  i  tops
       fönster och anvädas när man läser och skriver en konfigurationsfil.
