     ssh(1) obtains configuration data from the following[m
     sources in the following order:[m
[m
           1.   command-line options[m
           2.   user's configuration file ([4m~/.ssh/config[24m)[m

                ([4m/etc/ssh/ssh_config[24m)[m
[m
     For each parameter, the first obtained value will be used.[m

     specifications, and that section is only applied for hosts[m
     that match one of the patterns given in the specification.[m
     The matched host name is usually the one given on the com‐[m
     mand line (see the [1mCanonicalizeHostname[0m option for excep‐[m

[m
     Since the first obtained value for each parameter is used,[m
     more host-specific declarations should be given near the[m
     beginning of the file, and general defaults at the end.[m
[m
     Note that the Debian [1mopenssh-client[0m package sets several[m

     The file contains keyword-argument pairs, one per line.[m
