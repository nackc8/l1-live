BASH(1)                               General Commands Manual                               BASH(1)

NAME
       bash - GNU Bourne-Again SHell

SYNOPSIS
       bash [options] [command_string | file]

COPYRIGHT
       Bash is Copyright (C) 1989-2022 by the Free Software Foundation, Inc.

DESCRIPTION
       Bash  is  an sh-compatible command language interpreter that executes commands read from the
       standard input or from a file.  Bash also incorporates useful features from the Korn  and  C
       shells (ksh and csh).

GREP(1)                                    User Commands                                    GREP(1)

NAME
       grep, egrep, fgrep, rgrep - print lines that match patterns

SYNOPSIS
       grep [OPTION...] PATTERNS [FILE...]
       grep [OPTION...] -e PATTERNS ... [FILE...]
       grep [OPTION...] -f PATTERN_FILE ... [FILE...]

DESCRIPTION
       grep  searches  for  PATTERNS  in  each FILE.  PATTERNS is one or more patterns separated by
       newline characters, and grep prints each line that matches a  pattern.   Typically  PATTERNS
       should be quoted when grep is used in a shell command.

       A  FILE  of  “-” stands for standard input.  If no FILE is given, recursive searches examine
       the working directory, and nonrecursive searches read standard input.

       Debian also includes the variant programs egrep, fgrep and rgrep.  These  programs  are  the
       same  as  grep -E,  grep -F,  and  grep -r,  respectively.   These  variants  are deprecated
       upstream, but Debian provides for backward compatibility. For  portability  reasons,  it  is
       recommended to avoid the variant programs, and use grep with the related option instead.

              This option is useful for passing to shell scripts that already use -i, to cancel its
              effects because the two options override each other.

              Select  only  those lines containing matches that form whole words.  The test is that
              the matching substring must either be at the beginning of the line, or preceded by  a
              non-word  constituent character.  Similarly, it must be either at the end of the line
              or followed by a non-word constituent  character.   Word-constituent  characters  are
              letters,  digits,  and  the  underscore.   This  option  has  no effect if -x is also

              would normally have been printed.  Scanning each input file stops upon first match.
 ESESCOBpage grep(1) line 85 (press h for help or q to quit)
       -m NUM, --max-count=NUMpress h for help or q to quit)
              Stop reading a file after NUM matching lines.  If NUM is zero, grep stops right  away
              without  reading  input.   A NUM of -1 is treated as infinity and grep does not stop;
              this is the default.  If the input is standard input from a  regular  file,  and  NUM
              matching lines are output, grep ensures that the standard input is positioned to just
              after the last matching line before exiting, regardless of the presence  of  trailing
              context  lines.   This enables a calling process to resume a search.  When grep stops
              after NUM matching lines, it outputs any trailing context  lines.   When  the  -c  or
              --count option is also used, grep does not output a count greater than NUM.  When the
              -v or --invert-match option is also  used,  grep  stops  after  outputting  NUM  non-
              matching lines.(press h for help or q to quit)

       -h, --no-filenamee 119 (press h for help or q to quit)
              Suppress the prefixing of file names on output.  This is the default  when  there  is
              only one file (or only standard input) to search.
 ESESCOBpage grep(1) line 122 (press h for help or q to quit)
       --label=LABEL line 123 (press h for help or q to quit)
              Display  input  actually  coming from standard input as input coming from file LABEL.
              This can be useful for commands that transform a file's  contents  before  searching,
              e.g., gzip -cd foo.gz | grep --label=foo -H 'some pattern'.  See also the -H option.
 ESESCOBpage grep(1) line 127 (press h for help or q to quit)

 ESESCOBpage grep(1) line 130 (press h for help or q to quit)
       -T, --initial-tabe 131 (press h for help or q to quit)
              Make sure that the first character of actual line content lies on a tab stop, so that
              the alignment of tabs looks normal.  This is useful with options  that  prefix  their
              output  to  the  actual  content: -H,-n, and -b.  In order to improve the probability
              that lines from a single file will all start at the same column, this also causes the
              line number and byte offset (if present) to be printed in a minimum size field width.
 ESESCOBpage grep(1) line 137 (press h for help or q to quit)
       -Z, --null(1) line 138 (press h for help or q to quit)
              Output  a  zero byte (the ASCII NUL character) instead of the character that normally
              follows a file name.  For example, grep -lZ outputs a zero byte after each file  name
              instead  of the usual newline.  This option makes the output unambiguous, even in the
              presence of file names containing unusual characters like newlines.  This option  can
              be  used  with  commands like find -print0, perl -0, sort -z, and xargs -0 to process
              arbitrary file names, even those that contain newline characters.
