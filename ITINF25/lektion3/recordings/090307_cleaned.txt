       The  TIME_STYLE  argument can be full-iso, long-iso,
       iso, locale, or +FORMAT.  FORMAT is interpreted like
       in  date(1).   If FORMAT is FORMAT1<newline>FORMAT2,
       then FORMAT1 applies to non-recent files and FORMAT2
       to  recent files.  TIME_STYLE prefixed with 'posix-'
       takes effect only outside the  POSIX  locale.   Also
       the TIME_STYLE environment variable sets the default
       style to use.

       The WHEN argument defaults to 'always' and can  also
       be 'auto' or 'never'.

       Using  color  to  distinguish file types is disabled
       both  by  default  and  with  --color=never.    With
       --color=auto,  ls  emits color codes only when stan‐
       dard output is connected to a terminal.  The LS_COL‐
       ORS  environment  variable  can change the settings.
       Use the dircolors(1) command to set it.

      --show-control-chars   show nongraphic characters as-is (the default,
                             unless program is 'ls' and output is a terminal)

  -Q, --quote-name           enclose entry names in double quotes
      --quoting-style=WORD   use quoting style WORD for entry names:
                             literal, locale, shell, shell-always,
                             shell-escape, shell-escape-always, c, escape

                               access time (-u): atime, access, use;
                               change time (-c): ctime, status;
                               birth time: birth, creation;
                             with -l, WORD determines which time to show;
                             with --sort=time, sort by WORD (newest first)

                             with -l: show access time and sort by name;
                             otherwise: sort by access time, newest first

  -U                         do not sort; list entries in directory order
  -v                         natural sort of (version) numbers within text
  -w, --width=COLS           set output width to COLS.  0 means no limit
  -x                         list entries by lines instead of by columns

      --version     output version information and exit

The SIZE argument is an integer and optional unit (example: 10K is 10*1024).
Units are K,M,G,T,P,E,Z,Y (powers of 1024) or KB,MB,... (powers of 1000).
Binary prefixes can be used, too: KiB=K, MiB=M, and so on.

The TIME_STYLE argument can be full-iso, long-iso, iso, locale, or +FORMAT.
FORMAT is interpreted like in date(1).  If FORMAT is FORMAT1<newline>FORMAT2,
then FORMAT1 applies to non-recent files and FORMAT2 to recent files.
TIME_STYLE prefixed with 'posix-' takes effect only outside the POSIX locale.
Also the TIME_STYLE environment variable sets the default style to use.

The WHEN argument defaults to 'always' and can also be 'auto' or 'never'.

Using color to distinguish file types is disabled both by default and
with --color=never.  With --color=auto, ls emits color codes only when
standard output is connected to a terminal.  The LS_COLORS environment
variable can change the settings.  Use the dircolors(1) command to set it.

Exit status:
 0  if OK,
 1  if minor problems (e.g., cannot access subdirectory),
 2  if serious trouble (e.g., cannot access command-line argument).

$ help cd
cd: cd [-L|[-P [-e]] [-@]] [dir]
    Change the shell working directory.
    
    Change the current directory to DIR.  The default DIR is the value of the
    HOME shell variable. If DIR is "-", it is converted to $OLDPWD.
    
    The variable CDPATH defines the search path for the directory containing
    DIR.  Alternative directory names in CDPATH are separated by a colon (:).
    A null directory name is the same as the current directory.  If DIR begins
    with a slash (/), then CDPATH is not used.
    
    If the directory is not found, and the shell option `cdable_vars' is set,
    the word is assumed to be  a variable name.  If that variable has a value,
    its value is used for DIR.
    
    Options:
      -L	force symbolic links to be followed: resolve symbolic
    		links in DIR after processing instances of `..'
      -P	use the physical directory structure without following
    		symbolic links: resolve symbolic links in DIR before
    		processing instances of `..'
      -e	if the -P option is supplied, and the current working
    		directory cannot be determined successfully, exit with
    		a non-zero status
      -@	on systems that support it, present a file with extended
    		attributes as a directory containing the file attributes
    
    The default is to follow symbolic links, as if `-L' were specified.
    `..' is processed by removing the immediately previous pathname component
    back to a slash or the beginning of DIR.
    
    Exit Status:
    Returns 0 if the directory is changed, and if $PWD is set successfully when
    -P is used; non-zero otherwise.

DESCRIPTION
     sudo allows a permitted user to execute a command as
     the superuser or another user, as specified by the se‐
     curity policy.  The invoking user's real (not
     effective) user-ID is used to determine the user name
     with which to query the security policy.

     sudo supports a plugin architecture for security poli‐
     cies, auditing, and input/output logging.  Third par‐
     ties can develop and distribute their own plugins to
     work seamlessly with the sudo front-end.  The default
     security policy is sudoers, which is configured via
     the file /etc/sudoers, or via LDAP.  See the Plugins
     section for more information.

     The security policy determines what privileges, if
     any, a user has to run sudo.  The policy may require
     that users authenticate themselves with a password or)
     another authentication mechanism.  If authentication
     is required, sudo will exit if the user's password is
     not entered within a configurable time limit.  This
     limit is policy-specific; the default password prompt
     timeout for the sudoers security policy is 0 minutes.

     Security policies may support credential caching to
     allow the user to run sudo again for a period of time
     without requiring authentication.  By default, the
     sudoers policy caches credentials on a per-terminal
     basis for 15 minutes.  See the timestamp_type and
     timestamp_timeout options in sudoers(5) for more in‐
     formation.  By running sudo with the -v option, a user
     can update the cached credentials without running a
     command.

     On systems where sudo is the primary method of gaining
     superuser privileges, it is imperative to avoid syntax
     errors in the security policy configuration files.
     For the default security policy, sudoers(5), changes
     to the configuration files should be made using the
     visudo(8) utility which will ensure that no syntax er‐
     rors are introduced.

     When invoked as sudoedit, the -e option (described be‐
     low), is implied.

     Security policies and audit plugins may log successful
     and failed attempts to run sudo.  If an I/O plugin is
     configured, the running command's input and output may
     be logged as well.

     The options are as follows:

     -A, --askpass
             Normally, if sudo requires a password, it will
             read it from the user's terminal.  If the -A
             (askpass) option is specified, a (possibly
             graphical) helper program is executed to read
             the user's password and output the password to
             the standard output.  If the SUDO_ASKPASS en‐
             vironment variable is set, it specifies the
             path to the helper program.  Otherwise, if
             sudo.conf(5) contains a line specifying the
             askpass program, that value will be used.  For
             example:

                 # Path to askpass helper program
                 Path askpass /usr/X11R6/bin/ssh-askpass

             If no askpass program is available, sudo will
             exit with an error.

             Normally, if sudo requires a password, it will
             read it from the user's terminal.  If the -A
             (askpass) option is specified, a (possibly
             graphical) helper program is executed to read
             the user's password and output the password to
             the standard output.  If the SUDO_ASKPASS en‐
             vironment variable is set, it specifies the
             path to the helper program.  Otherwise, if
             sudo.conf(5) contains a line specifying the
             askpass program, that value will be used.  For
             example:

                 # Path to askpass helper program
                 Path askpass /usr/X11R6/bin/ssh-askpass

             If no askpass program is available, sudo will
             exit with an error.

             Normally, if sudo requires a password, it will
             read it from the user's terminal.  If the -A
             (askpass) option is specified, a (possibly
             graphical) helper program is executed to read
             the user's password and output the password to
             the standard output.  If the SUDO_ASKPASS en‐
             vironment variable is set, it specifies the
             path to the helper program.  Otherwise, if
             sudo.conf(5) contains a line specifying the
             askpass program, that value will be used.  For
             example:

                 # Path to askpass helper program
                 Path askpass /usr/X11R6/bin/ssh-askpass

             If no askpass program is available, sudo will
             exit with an error.

...skipping...
             sudo.  Most interactive commands will fail to
             work properly in background mode.

     -C num, --close-from=num
             Close all file descriptors greater than or
             equal to num before executing a command.  Val‐
             ues less than three are not permitted.  By de‐
             fault, sudo will close all open file descrip‐
             tors other than standard input, standard out‐
             put, and standard error when executing a
             command.  The security policy may restrict the
             user's ability to use this option.  The
             sudoers policy only permits use of the -C op‐
             tion when the administrator has enabled the
             closefrom_override option.

     -D directory, --chdir=directory
             Run the command in the specified directory in‐
...skipping...o(8) line 100 (press h for help or q to quit)
             specified, an interactive shell is executed.
             sudo attempts to change to that user's home
             directory before running the shell.  The
             command is run with an environment similar to
             the one a user would receive at log in.  Most
             shells behave differently when a command is
             specified as compared to an interactive ses‐
             sion; consult the shell's manual for details.
             The Command environment section in the
             sudoers(5) manual documents how the -i option
             affects the environment in which a command is
             run when the sudoers policy is in use.

     -K, --remove-timestamp
             Similar to the -k option, except that it re‐
             moves every cached credential for the user,
             regardless of the terminal or parent process
             ID.  The next time sudo is run, a password
             must be entered if the security policy re‐t)
             quires authentication.  It is not possible to
             use the -K option in conjunction with a
             command or other option.  This option does not
             require a password.  Not all security policies
             support credential caching.

     -n, --non-interactive
             Avoid prompting the user for input of any
             kind.  If a password is required for the
             command to run, sudo will display an error
             message and exit.

     -P, --preserve-groups
             Preserve the invoking user's group vector un‐
             altered.  By default, the sudoers policy will
             initialize the group vector to the list of
             groups the target user is a member of.  The
             real and effective group-IDs, however, are
             still set to match the target user.

     -p prompt, --prompt=prompt
             Use a custom password prompt with optional es‐
             cape sequences.  The following percent (‘%’)
             escape sequences are supported by the sudoers

             If no command is specified, an interactive
             shell is executed.  Most shells behave differ‐
             ently when a command is specified as compared
             to an interactive session; consult the shell's
             manual for details.

     -t type, --type=type
             Run the command with an SELinux security con‐
             text that includes the specified type.  If no
             type is specified, the default type is derived
             from the role.

     -U user, --other-user=user
             Used in conjunction with the -l option to list
             the privileges for user instead of for the in‐
             voking user.  The security policy may restrict
             listing other users' privileges.  When using
             the sudoers policy, the -U option is re‐

DESCRIPTION
     sudo allows a permitted user to execute a command as
     the superuser or another user, as specified by the se‐
     curity policy.  The invoking user's real (not
     effective) user-ID is used to determine the user name
     with which to query the security policy.

     sudo supports a plugin architecture for security poli‐
     cies, auditing, and input/output logging.  Third par‐
     ties can develop and distribute their own plugins to
     work seamlessly with the sudo front-end.  The default
     security policy is sudoers, which is configured via
     the file /etc/sudoers, or via LDAP.  See the Plugins
     section for more information. h for help or q to quit)

     The security policy determines what privileges, if
     any, a user has to run sudo.  The policy may require
     that users authenticate themselves with a password or
     another authentication mechanism.  If authentication

             character (e.g., ‘#0’ for GID 0).  When run‐
             ning a command as a GID, many shells require
             that the ‘#’ be escaped with a backslash
             (‘\’).  If no -u option is specified, the
             command will be run as the invoking user.  In
             either case, the primary group will be set to

     -i, --login
             Run the shell specified by the target user's
             password database entry as a login shell.
             This means that login-specific resource files
             such as .profile, .bash_profile, or .login
             will be read by the shell.  If a command is
             specified, it is passed to the shell as a sim‐
             ple command using the -c option.  The command
             and any args are concatenated, separated by
             spaces, after escaping each character
             (including white space) with a backslash (‘\’)
             except for alphanumerics, underscores, hy‐
             phens, and dollar signs.  If no command is

             sudo attempts to change to that user's home
             directory before running the shell.  The
             command is run with an environment similar to

USERMOD(8)       System Management Commands      USERMOD(8)

NAME
       usermod - modify a user account

SYNOPSIS
       usermod [options] LOGIN

DESCRIPTION
       The usermod command modifies the system account
       files.

OPTIONS
       The options which apply to the usermod command are:

       -a, --append
           Add the user to the supplementary group(s). Use
           only with the -G option.
 ESESCOBe usermod(8) line 1 (press h for help or q to quit)

           If the -m option is given, the contents of thet)
           current home directory will be moved to the new)
           home directory, which is created if it does not)
           already exist. If the current home directoryuit)
           does not exist the new home directory will nott)
           be created.ne 18 (press h for help or q to quit)

       -e, --expiredate EXPIRE_DATE
           The date on which the user account will be
           disabled. The date is specified in the format
           YYYY-MM-DD. Integers as input are interpreted as
           days after 1970-01-01.

           An input of -1 or an empty string will blank the
           account expiration field in the shadow password
           file. The account will remain available with no
           date limit.

           This option requires a /etc/shadow file. A
           /etc/shadow entry will be created if there were
           none.

       -f, --inactive INACTIVE
           defines the number of days after the passwordit)
           exceeded its maximum age during which the user
           may still login by immediately replacing the
           password. This grace period before the account
           becomes inactive is stored in the shadow
           password file. An input of 0 will disable an
           expired password with no delay. An input of -1
           will blank the respective field in the shadow
           password file. See shadow(5) for more
           information.

           This option requires a /etc/shadow file. A
           /etc/shadow entry will be created if there were
           none.

       -g, --gid GROUP
           The name or numerical ID of the user's new
           primary group. The group must exist.
ual page usermod(8) line 54 (press h for help or q to quit)
           Any file from the user's home directory owned by
           the previous primary group of the user will be
           owned by this new group.

           The group ownership of files outside of the
           user's home directory must be fixed manually.

           The change of the group ownership of files
           inside of the user's home directory is also not
           done if the home dir owner uid is different from
           the current or new user id. This is a safety
           measure for special home directories such as /.

       -G, --groups GROUP1[,GROUP2,...[,GROUPN]]]
           A list of supplementary groups which the user is
           also a member of. Each group is separated from
           the next by a comma, with no intervening
           whitespace. The groups must exist. or q to quit)

           If the user is currently a member of a group
           which is not listed, the user will be removed
           from the group. This behaviour can be changed
           via the -a option, which appends the user to the
           current supplementary group list.

       -l, --login NEW_LOGIN
           The name of the user will be changed from LOGIN
           to NEW_LOGIN. Nothing else is changed. In
           particular, the user's home directory or mail
           spool should probably be renamed manually to
           reflect the new login name.

       -L, --lock
           Lock a user's password. This puts a '!' in front
           of the encrypted password, effectively disabling
           the password. You can't use this option with -p)
           or -U.

           Note: if you wish to lock the account (not only
           access with a password), you should also set the
           EXPIRE_DATE to 1.

       -m, --move-home
           moves the content of the user's home directory
           to the new location. If the current home
           directory does not exist the new home directory
           will not be created.

           This option is only valid in combination with
           the -d (or --home) option.

           usermod will try to adapt the ownership of the
           files and to copy the modes, ACL and extended
           attributes, but manual changes might be neededt)
           afterwards.

       -o, --non-unique
           allows to change the user ID to a non-unique
           value.

           This option is only valid in combination with
           the -u option. As a user identity serves as key
           to map between users on one hand and
           permissions, file ownerships and other aspects
           that determine the system's behavior on the
           other hand, more than one login name will access
           the account of the given UID.

       -p, --password PASSWORD
           defines a new password for the user. PASSWORD is
           expected to be encrypted, as returned by crypt
           (3).(8) line 126 (press h for help or q to quit)

           Note: Avoid this option on the command line
           because the password (or encrypted password)
           will be visible by users listing the processes.

           The password will be written in the local
           /etc/passwd or /etc/shadow file. This might
           differ from the password database configured in
           your PAM configuration.

           You should make sure the password respects the
           system's password policy.

       -r, --remove
           Remove the user from named supplementary
           group(s). Use only with the -G option.

       -R, --root CHROOT_DIR(press h for help or q to quit)
           Apply changes in the CHROOT_DIR directory and
           use the configuration files from the CHROOT_DIR
           directory. Only absolute paths are supported.

       -P, --prefix PREFIX_DIR
           Apply changes within the directory tree starting
           with PREFIX_DIR and use as well the
           configuration files located there. This option
           does not chroot and is intended for preparing a
           cross-compilation target. Some limitations: NIS
           and LDAP users/groups are not verified. PAM
           authentication is using the host files. No
           SELINUX support.

       -s, --shell SHELL
           changes the user's login shell. An empty string
           for SHELL blanks the field in /etc/passwd and
           logs the user into the system's default shell.t)

       -u, --uid UID
           The new value of the user's ID.

           This value must be unique, unless the -o option
           is used. The value must be non-negative.

           The user's mailbox, and any files which the user
           owns and which are located in the user's home
           directory will have the file user ID changed
           automatically.

           The ownership of files outside of the user's
           home directory must be fixed manually.

           The change of the user ownership of files inside
           of the user's home directory is also not done if
