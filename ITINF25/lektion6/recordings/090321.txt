[7m Manual page find(1) line 1 (press h for help or q to quit)[27m[K[K       This manual page documents the GNU version of [1mfind[0m.  GNU[m
       [1mfind[0m  searches  the  directory tree rooted at each given[m
       starting-point by evaluating the given  expression  from[m
       left to right, according to the rules of precedence (see[m
       section OPERATORS), until the outcome is known (the left[m
       hand  side is false for [4mand[24m operations, true for [4mor[24m), at[m
       which point [1mfind[0m moves on to the next file name.  If  no[m
       starting-point is specified, `.' is assumed.[m

       If  you  are using [1mfind[0m in an environment where security[m
[7m Manual page find(1) line 11 (press h for help or q to quit)[27m[K[K       is important (for example if you are using it to  search[m
       directories  that  are  writable  by  other  users), you[m
       should read the `Security Considerations' chapter of the[m
       findutils  documentation,  which is called [1mFinding[0m [1mFiles[0m[m
       and comes with findutils.  That document also includes a[m
       lot more detail and discussion than this manual page, so[m
       you may find it a more useful source of information.[m

[1mOPTIONS[0m[m
       The [1m-H[0m, [1m-L[0m and [1m-P[0m options control the treatment of  sym‐[m

       taken to be names of files or directories  to  be  exam‐[m
       ined,  up to the first argument that begins with `-', or[m
       the argument `(' or `!'.  That argument and any  follow‐[m
       ing  arguments are taken to be the expression describing[m
       what is to be searched for.  If no paths are given,  the[m
       current  directory  is used.  If no expression is given,[m
       the expression [1m-print[0m is used (but you  should  probably[m
       consider using [1m-print0[0m instead, anyway).[m
[m
[7m Manual page find(1) line 31 (press h for help or q to quit)[27m[K[K       This  manual  page  talks about `options' within the ex‐[m
       pression list.  These options control the  behaviour  of[m
       [1mfind[0m  but  are specified immediately after the last path[m
       name.  The five `real' options [1m-H[0m, [1m-L[0m,  [1m-P[0m,  [1m-D[0m  and  [1m-O[0m[m
       must  appear  before  the first path name, if at all.  A[m
       double dash [1m--[0m could theoretically  be  used  to  signal[m
       that  any  remaining arguments are not options, but this[m
       does not really work due to the way [1mfind[0m determines  the[m
       end  of  the  following  path arguments: it does that by[m
       reading until an expression argument comes  (which  also[m
[7m Manual page find(1) line 41 (press h for help or q to quit)[27m[K[K       starts with a `-').  Now, if a path argument would start[m
       with a `-', then [1mfind[0m would treat it as expression argu‐[m
       ment instead.  Thus, to ensure that all start points are[m
       taken as such, and especially to prevent  that  wildcard[m
       patterns  expanded  by the calling shell are not mistak‐[m
       enly treated as expression arguments,  it  is  generally[m
       safer to prefix wildcards or dubious path names with ei‐[m
       ther `./' or to use absolute path  names  starting  with[m
       '/'.   Alternatively,  it  is generally safe though non-[m
       portable to use the GNU option [1m-files0-from[0m to pass  ar‐[m

              ception  to  this behaviour is when a file speci‐[m
              fied on the command line is a symbolic link,  and[m
              the  link  can  be resolved.  For that situation,[m
              the information used is taken from  whatever  the[m
[7m Manual page find(1) line 91 (press h for help or q to quit)[27m[K[K              link  points  to (that is, the link is followed).[m
              The information about the link itself is used  as[m
              a fallback if the file pointed to by the symbolic[m
              link cannot be examined.  If [1m-H[0m is in effect  and[m
              one of the paths specified on the command line is[m
              a symbolic link to a directory, the  contents  of[m
              that directory will be examined (though of course[m
              [1m-maxdepth[0m [1m0[0m would prevent this).[m

[7m Manual page find(1) line 101 (press h for help or q to quit)[27m[K[K       overrides the others; the last one appearing on the com‐[m
       mand line takes effect.  Since it is the default, the [1m-P[0m[m
       option  should  be considered to be in effect unless ei‐[m

       GNU [1mfind[0m frequently stats files during the processing of[m
       the command line itself, before any searching has begun.[m
       These options also affect how those arguments  are  pro‐[m
       cessed.   Specifically, there are a number of tests that[m
       compare files listed on the command line against a  file[m
[7m Manual page find(1) line 111 (press h for help or q to quit)[27m[K[K       we  are  currently  considering.  In each case, the file[m
       specified on the command line will  have  been  examined[m
       and some of its properties will have been saved.  If the[m
       named file is in fact a symbolic link, and the [1m-P[0m option[m
       is  in  effect (or if neither [1m-H[0m nor [1m-L[0m were specified),[m
       the information used for the comparison  will  be  taken[m
       from the properties of the symbolic link.  Otherwise, it[m
       will be taken from the properties of the file  the  link[m
       points  to.  If [1mfind[0m cannot follow the link (for example[m
       because it  has  insufficient  privileges  or  the  link[m
[7m Manual page find(1) line 121 (press h for help or q to quit)[27m[K[K       points to a nonexistent file) the properties of the link[m
       itself will be used.[m
[m
       When the [1m-H[0m or [1m-L[0m options are in  effect,  any  symbolic[m
       links  listed as the argument of [1m-newer[0m will be derefer‐[m
       enced, and the timestamp will be taken from the file  to[m
       which  the symbolic link points.  The same consideration[m
       applies to [1m-newerXY[0m, [1m-anewer[0m and [1m-cnewer[0m.[m
[m
       The [1m-follow[0m option has a similar effect to [1m-L[0m, though it[m
[7m Manual page find(1) line 131 (press h for help or q to quit)[27m[K[K       takes  effect at the point where it appears (that is, if[m

    Display or manipulate the history list.
    
    Display the history list with line numbers, prefixing each modified
    entry with a `*'.  An argument of N lists only the last N entries.
    
    Options:
      -c	clear the history list by deleting all of the entries
      -d offset	delete the history entry at position OFFSET. Negative
    		offsets count back from the end of the history list

    If FILENAME is given, it is used as the history file.  Otherwise,
    if HISTFILE has a value, that is used, else ~/.bash_history.
    
    If the HISTTIMEFORMAT variable is set and not null, its value is used
    as a format string for strftime(3) to print the time stamp associated
    with each displayed history entry.  No time stamps are printed otherwise.
    
    Exit Status:
    Returns success unless an invalid option is given or an error occurs.

       The shell supports a history expansion feature  that  is[m
       similar  to  the history expansion in [1mcsh[0m.  This section[m
       describes what syntax features are available.  This fea‐[m
       ture  is  enabled by default for interactive shells, and[m
       can be disabled using the [1m+H[0m option to the  [1mset[0m  builtin[m
       command  (see [1mSHELL[0m [1mBUILTIN[0m [1mCOMMANDS[0m below).  Non-inter‐[m
       active shells do not perform history  expansion  by  de‐[m
       fault.[m
[m
       History expansions introduce words from the history list[m
       into the input stream, making it  easy  to  repeat  com‐[m
       mands,  insert  the arguments to a previous command into[m
       the current input line, or fix errors in  previous  com‐[m
