[7m Manual page find(1) line 1 (press h for help or q to quit)[27m[K[K       This manual page documents the GNU version of [1mfind[0m.  GNU[m
       [1mfind[0m  searches  the  directory tree rooted at each given[m
       starting-point by evaluating the given  expression  from[m
       left to right, according to the rules of precedence (see[m
       section OPERATORS), until the outcome is known (the left[m
       hand  side is false for [4mand[24m operations, true for [4mor[24m), at[m
       which point [1mfind[0m moves on to the next file name.  If  no[m
       starting-point is specified, `.' is assumed.[m

       If  you  are using [1mfind[0m in an environment where security[m
[7m Manual page find(1) line 11 (press h for help or q to quit)[27m[K[K       is important (for example if you are using it to  search[m
       directories  that  are  writable  by  other  users), you[m
       should read the `Security Considerations' chapter of the[m
       findutils  documentation,  which is called [1mFinding[0m [1mFiles[0m[m
       and comes with findutils.  That document also includes a[m
       lot more detail and discussion than this manual page, so[m
       you may find it a more useful source of information.[m

[1mOPTIONS[0m[m
       The [1m-H[0m, [1m-L[0m and [1m-P[0m options control the treatment of  sym‐[m

       taken to be names of files or directories  to  be  exam‐[m
       ined,  up to the first argument that begins with `-', or[m
       the argument `(' or `!'.  That argument and any  follow‐[m
       ing  arguments are taken to be the expression describing[m
       what is to be searched for.  If no paths are given,  the[m
       current  directory  is used.  If no expression is given,[m
       the expression [1m-print[0m is used (but you  should  probably[m
       consider using [1m-print0[0m instead, anyway).[m
[m
[7m Manual page find(1) line 31 (press h for help or q to quit)[27m[K[K       This  manual  page  talks about `options' within the ex‐[m
       pression list.  These options control the  behaviour  of[m
       [1mfind[0m  but  are specified immediately after the last path[m
       name.  The five `real' options [1m-H[0m, [1m-L[0m,  [1m-P[0m,  [1m-D[0m  and  [1m-O[0m[m
       must  appear  before  the first path name, if at all.  A[m
       double dash [1m--[0m could theoretically  be  used  to  signal[m
       that  any  remaining arguments are not options, but this[m
       does not really work due to the way [1mfind[0m determines  the[m
       end  of  the  following  path arguments: it does that by[m
       reading until an expression argument comes  (which  also[m
[7m Manual page find(1) line 41 (press h for help or q to quit)[27m[K[K       starts with a `-').  Now, if a path argument would start[m
       with a `-', then [1mfind[0m would treat it as expression argu‐[m
       ment instead.  Thus, to ensure that all start points are[m
       taken as such, and especially to prevent  that  wildcard[m
       patterns  expanded  by the calling shell are not mistak‐[m
       enly treated as expression arguments,  it  is  generally[m
       safer to prefix wildcards or dubious path names with ei‐[m
       ther `./' or to use absolute path  names  starting  with[m
       '/'.   Alternatively,  it  is generally safe though non-[m
       portable to use the GNU option [1m-files0-from[0m to pass  ar‐[m

              ception  to  this behaviour is when a file speci‐[m
              fied on the command line is a symbolic link,  and[m
              the  link  can  be resolved.  For that situation,[m
              the information used is taken from  whatever  the[m
[7m Manual page find(1) line 91 (press h for help or q to quit)[27m[K[K              link  points  to (that is, the link is followed).[m
              The information about the link itself is used  as[m
              a fallback if the file pointed to by the symbolic[m
              link cannot be examined.  If [1m-H[0m is in effect  and[m
              one of the paths specified on the command line is[m
              a symbolic link to a directory, the  contents  of[m
              that directory will be examined (though of course[m
              [1m-maxdepth[0m [1m0[0m would prevent this).[m

[7m Manual page find(1) line 101 (press h for help or q to quit)[27m[K[K       overrides the others; the last one appearing on the com‐[m
       mand line takes effect.  Since it is the default, the [1m-P[0m[m
       option  should  be considered to be in effect unless ei‐[m

       GNU [1mfind[0m frequently stats files during the processing of[m
       the command line itself, before any searching has begun.[m
       These options also affect how those arguments  are  pro‐[m
       cessed.   Specifically, there are a number of tests that[m
       compare files listed on the command line against a  file[m
[7m Manual page find(1) line 111 (press h for help or q to quit)[27m[K[K       we  are  currently  considering.  In each case, the file[m
       specified on the command line will  have  been  examined[m
       and some of its properties will have been saved.  If the[m
       named file is in fact a symbolic link, and the [1m-P[0m option[m
       is  in  effect (or if neither [1m-H[0m nor [1m-L[0m were specified),[m
       the information used for the comparison  will  be  taken[m
       from the properties of the symbolic link.  Otherwise, it[m
       will be taken from the properties of the file  the  link[m
       points  to.  If [1mfind[0m cannot follow the link (for example[m
       because it  has  insufficient  privileges  or  the  link[m
[7m Manual page find(1) line 121 (press h for help or q to quit)[27m[K[K       points to a nonexistent file) the properties of the link[m
       itself will be used.[m
[m
       When the [1m-H[0m or [1m-L[0m options are in  effect,  any  symbolic[m
       links  listed as the argument of [1m-newer[0m will be derefer‐[m
       enced, and the timestamp will be taken from the file  to[m
       which  the symbolic link points.  The same consideration[m
       applies to [1m-newerXY[0m, [1m-anewer[0m and [1m-cnewer[0m.[m
[m
       The [1m-follow[0m option has a similar effect to [1m-L[0m, though it[m
[7m Manual page find(1) line 131 (press h for help or q to quit)[27m[K[K       takes  effect at the point where it appears (that is, if[m
