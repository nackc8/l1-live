       When [1mbash[0m is invoked as an interactive login shell, or as a non-interac‚Äê[m
       tive shell with the [1m--login[0m option, it first reads and executes commands[m
       from  the  file  [4m/etc/profile[24m,  if that file exists.  After reading that[m
       file, it looks for [4m~/.bash_profile[24m, [4m~/.bash_login[24m,  and  [4m~/.profile[24m,  in[m
       that  order, and reads and executes commands from the first one that ex‚Äê[m
       ists and is readable.  The [1m--noprofile[0m option may be used when the shell[m
       is started to inhibit this behavior.[m
[m
       When  an interactive login shell exits, or a non-interactive login shell[m

       be quoted to prevent history expansion.[m
[m
       There are three quoting mechanisms: the [4mescape[24m [4mcharacter[24m, single quotes,[m
       and double quotes.[m
[m
       A  non-quoted  backslash  ([1m\[0m) is the [4mescape[24m [4mcharacter[24m.  It preserves the[m
       literal value of the next character that follows, with the exception  of[m
       <newline>.   If  a [1m\[0m<newline> pair appears, and the backslash is not it‚Äê[m
       self quoted, the [1m\[0m<newline> is treated as a line continuation (that  is,[m
       it is removed from the input stream and effectively ignored).[m
[m
       Enclosing  characters  in  single  quotes preserves the literal value of[m
       each character within the quotes.  A single quote may not occur  between[m
       single quotes, even when preceded by a backslash.[m
[m
       Enclosing characters in double quotes preserves the literal value of all[m
       characters within the quotes, with the exception of [1m$[0m, [1m`[0m, [1m\[0m,  and,  when[m
       history expansion is enabled, [1m![0m.  When the shell is in [4mposix[24m [4mmode[24m, the [1m![0m[m
       has no special meaning within double quotes, even when history expansion[m

[m
   [1mSpecial[0m [1mParameters[0m[m
       The  shell  treats  several  parameters specially.  These parameters may[m
       only be referenced; assignment to them is not allowed.[m
       [1m*[0m      Expands to the positional parameters, starting  from  one.   When[m
              the expansion is not within double quotes, each positional param‚Äê[m
              eter expands to a separate word.  In contexts where  it  is  per‚Äê[m
              formed,  those  words  are  subject to further word splitting and[m
              pathname expansion.  When  the  expansion  occurs  within  double[m
              quotes, it expands to a single word with the value of each param‚Äê[m
              eter separated by the first character of the  [1mIFS[0m  special  vari‚Äê[m
              able.  That is, "[1m$*[0m" is equivalent to "[1m$1[0m[4mc[24m[1m$2[0m[4mc[24m[1m...[0m", where [4mc[24m is the[m
              first character of the value of the [1mIFS[0m variable.  If [1mIFS[0m is  un‚Äê[m
              set, the parameters are separated by spaces.  If [1mIFS[0m is null, the[m
              parameters are joined without intervening separators.[m
       [1m@[0m      Expands to the positional parameters, starting from one.  In con‚Äê[m
              texts  where word splitting is performed, this expands each posi‚Äê[m
              tional parameter to a separate word; if not within double quotes,[m
              these  words  are  subject  to word splitting.  In contexts where[m

              tokenization (see [1mHISTORY[0m [1m[7mEXPANSION[27m[0m below).  The first  character[m
              is  the  [4mhistory[24m [4mexpansion[24m character, the character which signals[m
              the start of a history expansion, normally `[1m![0m'.  The second char‚Äê[m
              acter  is  the  [4mquick[24m  [4msubstitution[24m  character,  which is used as[m
              shorthand for re-running the previous command entered, substitut‚Äê[m
              ing  one  string for another in the command.  The default is `[1m^[0m'.[m
              The optional third character is  the  character  which  indicates[m
              that  the  remainder  of  the line is a comment when found as the[m
              first character of a word, normally  `[1m#[0m'.   The  history  comment[m
              character  causes  history substitution to be skipped for the re‚Äê[m
              maining words on the line.  It does  not  necessarily  cause  the[m
              shell parser to treat the rest of the line as a comment.[m
