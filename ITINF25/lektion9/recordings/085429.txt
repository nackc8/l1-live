       The rules concerning the definition and use of aliases are somewhat confus‐[m
       ing.  [1mBash[0m always reads at least one complete line of input, and all  lines[m
       that  make  up  a compound command, before executing any of the commands on[m
       that line or the compound command.  Aliases are expanded when a command  is[m
       read, not when it is executed.  Therefore, an alias definition appearing on[m
       the same line as another command does not take effect until the  next  line[m
       of input is read.  The commands following the alias definition on that line[m
       are not affected by the new alias.  This behavior is  also  an  issue  when[m
       functions are executed.  Aliases are expanded when a function definition is[m
       read, not when the function is executed, because a function  definition  is[m
       itself  a command.  As a consequence, aliases defined in a function are not[m

       Each of the [4mmetacharacters[24m listed above under [1mDEFINITIONS[0m has special mean‐[m
       ing to the shell and must be quoted if it is to represent itself.[m
[m
       When the command history expansion facilities are being used  (see  [1mHISTORY[0m[m
       [1mEXPANSION[0m  below),  the  [4mhistory[24m  [4mexpansion[24m  character,  usually [1m![0m, must be[m
       quoted to prevent history expansion.[m
[m
       There are three quoting mechanisms: the [4mescape[24m  [4mcharacter[24m,  single  quotes,[m
       and double quotes.[m
[m
       A  non-quoted backslash ([1m\[0m) is the [4mescape[24m [4mcharacter[24m.  It preserves the lit‐[m
       eral value of the next character that follows, with the exception of  <new‐[m

       until the closing [1m}[0m.[m
[m
       This construct is typically used as shorthand when the common prefix of the[m
       strings to be generated is longer than in the above example:[m

       Brace  expansion  introduces  a slight incompatibility with historical ver‐[m
       sions of [1msh[0m.  [1msh[0m does not treat opening or closing  braces  specially  when[m
       they  appear as part of a word, and preserves them in the output.  [1mBash[0m re‐[m
