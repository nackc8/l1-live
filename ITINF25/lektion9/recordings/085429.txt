       The rules concerning the definition and use of aliases are somewhat confus‚Äê[m
       ing.  [1mBash[0m always reads at least one complete line of input, and all  lines[m
       that  make  up  a compound command, before executing any of the commands on[m
       that line or the compound command.  Aliases are expanded when a command  is[m
       read, not when it is executed.  Therefore, an alias definition appearing on[m
       the same line as another command does not take effect until the  next  line[m
       of input is read.  The commands following the alias definition on that line[m
       are not affected by the new alias.  This behavior is  also  an  issue  when[m
       functions are executed.  Aliases are expanded when a function definition is[m
       read, not when the function is executed, because a function  definition  is[m
       itself  a command.  As a consequence, aliases defined in a function are not[m
